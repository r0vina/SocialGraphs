With each new recording and his continued touring, his popularity was increasing.\n\nTeaming up with [[Brent Maher]] and Steve Gibson in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Johnson created a two-song demo consisting of \"[[Bluer Than Blue]]\" and \"[[Almost Like Being in Love]]\" (the latter song from the Broadway musical ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]''). [[EMI America]] took one listen and wasted no time in signing him, quickly getting ''The Michael Johnson Album'' out in 1978. \"Bluer Than Blue\" was written by Randy Goodrum.
