In 1955, he moved to [[New York City]], where he worked with bandleader and theorist [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]].

In 1961, they recorded two albums during an engagement at New York's [[Village Vanguard]] jazz club, ''[[Sunday at the Village Vanguard]]'' and ''[[Waltz for Debby (1962 album)|Waltz for Debby]]''; a complete set of their Vanguard recordings on three CDs was issued decades later. However, ten days after this booking ended, LaFaro died in a car accident. After months without public performances, Evans reemerged with a new trio, now featuring [[Chuck Israels]] on bass. In 1963, Evans recorded ''[[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]]'', a solo album produced with [[overdubbing]] technology.

There, Harry began piano lessons somewhere between ages 5 and 7 with local teacher Helen Leland. Bill was thought to be too young for lessons, but he began to play what he had heard during his brother's instruction,<ref name=\"pettinger\">{{harvnb|Pettinger|2002}}{{page needed|date=April 2021}}</ref>{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=9\u201310}} and soon both were taking piano lessons.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=10}}\n\nEvans remembered Leland with affection for not insisting on a heavy technical approach, with scales and arpeggios. He quickly developed a fluent sight-reading ability, but Leland considered Harry a better pianist.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=10}} At the age of seven, Bill began violin lessons, and soon also flute and [[piccolo]]. He soon dropped those instruments, but it is believed they later influenced his keyboard style. He later named [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Schubert]] as composers whose work he often played.<ref name=\"interv harry\" /> During high school, Evans came in contact with 20th-century music like [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s [[Petrushka (ballet)|''Petrushka'']], which he called a \"tremendous experience\", and [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]]'s ''[[Suite proven\u00e7ale]]'', whose bitonal language he believed \"opened him to new things.\" Around the same time came his first exposure to jazz, when at age 12 he heard [[Tommy Dorsey]] and [[Harry James]]'s bands on the radio. At age 13, Bill stood in for a sick pianist in Buddy Valentino's rehearsal band,{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=11\u201312}} where Harry was already playing the trumpet.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=11\u201312}}<ref name=\"Allmus\" /> Soon he began to perform for dances and weddings throughout New Jersey, playing music like [[boogie-woogie]] and [[polka]]s for $1 per hour.<ref name=\"mcpar\" /> Around this time, he met multi-instrumentalist [[Don Elliott]], with whom he later recorded. Another important influence was bassist George Platt, who introduced Evans to the theory of harmony.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=12\u201313}}\n\nEvans also listened to [[Earl Hines]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Bud Powell]], [[George Shearing]], [[Stan Getz]], and [[Nat King Cole]] among others.

He was a founding member of SLU's Delta Omega chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], played [[quarterback]] for the fraternity's football team, and played in the college band. In 1950, he performed Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 3]] on his senior recital, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Music]] in piano and a bachelor's in music education. Evans regarded his last three years in college as the happiest of his life.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=16\u201319}}\n\n[[File:Bill Evans Graduation Concert.jpg|thumb|Program of Evans's graduation concert. April 24, 1950.]]\nDuring college, Evans met guitarist [[Mundell Lowe]], and after graduating, they formed a trio with bassist [[Red Mitchell]]. The three relocated to New York City, but their inability to attract bookings prompted them to leave for [[Calumet City, Illinois]].{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=20}} In July 1950, Evans joined [[Herbie Fields]]'s band, based in Chicago. During the summer, the band did a three-month tour backing [[Billie Holiday]], including East Coast appearances at Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]] and shows in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. The band included trumpeter [[Jimmy Nottingham]], trombonist [[Frank Rosolino]] and bassist [[Jim Aton]]. Upon its return to Chicago, Evans and Aton worked as a duo in clubs, often backing singer [[Lurlean Hunter]]. Shortly thereafter, Evans received his [[Conscription|draft notice]] and entered the [[U.S. Army]].\n\nDuring his three-year (1951\u201354) period in the Army,<ref name=\"Allmus\" /> Evans played flute, piccolo, and piano in the [[United States Army Band|Fifth U.S. Army Band]] at [[Sheridan Reserve Center|Fort Sheridan]]. He hosted a jazz program on the camp radio station and occasionally performed in Chicago clubs, where he met singer [[Lucy Reed]], with whom he became friends and later recorded. He met singer and bassist Bill Scott and Chicago jazz pianist Sam Distefano (his bunkmate in their platoon), both of whom became Evans's close friends. Evans's stay in the Army was traumatic, however, and he had nightmares for years. As people criticized his musical conceptions and playing, he lost confidence for the first time.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=19\u201320}} Around 1953, Evans composed his best-known tune, \"[[Waltz for Debby (song)|Waltz for Debby]]\", for his young niece.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=37}} During this period, he began using recreational drugs, occasionally smoking marijuana.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=61}}\n\nEvans was discharged from the Army in January 1954, and entered a period of seclusion triggered by the harsh criticism he had received. He took a sabbatical year and lived with his parents, where he set up a studio, acquired a grand piano and worked on his technique, believing he lacked the natural fluency of other musicians. He visited his brother, now in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], recently married and working as a conservatory teacher.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\n=== Return to New York City ===\nIn July 1955, Evans returned to New York City and enrolled in the [[Mannes College of Music]] for a three-semester postgraduate course in music composition. He also wrote [[Musical setting|classical settings]] of poems by [[William Blake]]. Along with his studies, Evans played in low-profile \"Tuxedo gigs\" at the Friendship Club and the [[Roseland Ballroom]], as well as Jewish weddings, intermission spots, and over-40 dances. Better opportunities also arose, such as playing solo opposite the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] at the [[Village Vanguard]], where one day he saw [[Miles Davis]] listening to him. During this period, Evans also met [[Thelonious Monk]].<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nEvans soon began to perform in [[Greenwich Village]] clubs with [[Don Elliott]], [[Tony Scott (musician)|Tony Scott]], [[Mundell Lowe]], and bandleader [[Jerry Wald (musician)|Jerry Wald]]. He may have played on some of Wald's discs, but his first proven Wald recording is ''Listen to the Music of Jerry Wald'', which also featured his future drummer [[Paul Motian]].<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nIn early 1955, singer [[Lucy Reed]] moved to New York City to play at the Village Vanguard and [[The Blue Angel (New York nightclub)|The Blue Angel]], and in August she recorded ''The Singing Reed'' with a four-piece group that included Evans. During this period, he met two of Reed's friends: manager [[Helen Keane (jazz)|Helen Keane]], who became his agent seven years later, and [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], with whom he soon worked. That year, he recorded with <!-- guitarist plus trio -->guitarist [[Dick Garcia]] on ''A Message from Garcia'' for the [[Dawn Records (American label)|Dawn]] label. In parallel, Evans kept up his work with Scott, playing in Preview's Modern Jazz Club in Chicago during December 1956\u2013January 1957, and recording ''The Complete Tony Scott''. After the ''Complete'' sessions, Scott left for a long overseas tour.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\n=== Debut album ''New Jazz Conceptions'' ===\nIn September 1956, producer [[Orrin Keepnews]] was convinced to record the reluctant Evans by a demo tape [[Mundell Lowe]] played to him over the phone. The result was his debut album, ''[[New Jazz Conceptions]]'', featuring the original versions of \"[[Waltz for Debby (song)|Waltz for Debby]]\" and \"Five\".<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Eleven songs were recorded in the first session, including Evans' original composition \"[[Waltz for Debby (song)|Waltz for Debby]]\", which would prove to be his most recognized and recorded composition.<ref name=\"AMB\">{{Cite web |date=August 27, 2004|title=Bill Evans: 1929\u20131980 |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/bill-evans-1929-1980-bill-evans-by-aaj-staff/|access-date=July 10, 2023|website=All About Jazz}}</ref> The album began Evans's relationship with [[Riverside Records]], and also marked the formation of the first Bill Evans trio with Teddy Kotick (bass) and [[Paul Motian]] (drums).

Russell's first impression of Evans was negative (\"this is going to be like pulling teeth all day\"), but when he secretly heard Evans play, he completely changed his mind.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Russell was then developing his magnum opus, the treatise ''[[Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization]]'', in which he argued that the [[Lydian mode]] was more compatible with [[tonality]] than the [[major scale]] used in most music. This was groundbreaking in jazz, and soon influenced musicians like [[Miles Davis]]. Evans, who was already acquainted with these ideas, began to work with Russell in 1956.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nBy this time, [[RCA Victor]] had begun a series of recordings called ''Jazz Workshop'', and soon Russell, through the intervention of [[Hal McKusick]] and Jack Lewis, gained his own record date titled [[The Jazz Workshop]] and released in 1957. At that time, Russell assembled trumpeter [[Art Farmer]], guitarist [[Barry Galbraith]], bassist [[Milt Hinton]] and Bill Evans on piano for three recording dates, along with several rehearsal sessions. Initially, for these sessions, only the bassist was given a written part, while the rest were left, and, according to Farmer, \"took the parts at home and tried to come to terms with them\". The album took a year to make, and was successful enough to enable Russell to escape his penurious lifestyle.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Evans performed a significant solo in \"Concerto for Billy the Kid\".<ref name=\"Allmus\" />\n<!--Insert German Wikipedia quote from the critics about Evans in \"Concerto for Billy the Kid\" and \"All About Rosie\"-->\n\nIn 1957, Russell was one of six composers (three jazz, three classical) [[Brandeis University]] commissioned to write a piece for its Festival of the Creative Arts in the context of the first experiments in [[third stream]] jazz.

At this time, [[John Coltrane]], [[Cannonball Adderley]], [[Paul Chambers]] and [[Philly Joe Jones]] were the other members of Davis' group. [[Red Garland]] had recently been fired, and Evans knew he was not merely filling in for one night but auditioning to become the group's regular pianist.

The band appeared in radio broadcasts on Saturday nights and, on May 3, the new formation made its first broadcast from [[Caf\u00e9 Bohemia]] (its usual locale). The live radio appearance that was broadcast on May 17, 1958, and also released on the album titled ''Makin' Wax'', is known as the earliest documented evidence of the collaboration between Bill Evans and Miles Davis.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=53}} By mid-May, [[Jimmy Cobb]] replaced Philly Joe Jones, with whom Evans had developed a close friendship. On May 26, Evans made his first studio recordings with Davis, which were first issued as part of ''Jazz Track'',{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=54}} and later reissued on ''[[1958 Miles]]''.\n\nA performance of the [[Ballets Africains]] from [[Guinea]] in 1958 sparked Davis' interest in modal music. This music stayed for long periods of time on a single chord, weaving in and out of consonance and dissonance.<ref>{{cite book |last =Early |first =Gerald Lyn |title =Miles Davis and American Culture |publisher =Missouri Historical Society Press |year =2001 |isbn =1-883982-38-3 }}</ref> Another influence was [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s treatise. Both influences coalesced in Davis' conception of modal jazz offering an alternative to chord changes and major/minor [[key (music)|key]] relationships, relying instead on a series of modal scales. He realized that Evans, who had worked with Russell, could follow him into modal music. At the same time, Evans introduced Davis to twentieth-century classical composers such as [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Maurice Ravel]], and [[Aram Khachaturian]].<ref name=\"Allmus\" />\n\nThe band's mostly black followers did not react favourably to the replacement of Garland with a white musician.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /><ref name=milesbill /> Davis used to tease him and Evans's sensitivity perhaps let it get to him.

While Davis was not very satisfied with the performance, he said that from then on, Evans was the only one to play it in the way he wanted. The piece came to be associated with Evans's future trios, which played it frequently.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nBy the end of the summer, Davis knew Evans was quickly approaching his full professional development; and that he would soon decide to leave Davis' group.<ref name=milesbill /> This year, Evans won the ''[[DownBeat]]'' International Critics' Poll for his work with Davis and his album ''New Jazz Conceptions''.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=65}}\n\nIn September 1958, Evans recorded as a sideman in Art Farmer's album ''[[Modern Art (Art Farmer album)|Modern Art]]'', also featuring [[Benny Golson]]. All three had won the ''DownBeat'' poll. {{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=65}} Later, Evans deemed this record as one of his favorites. During this period, despite all the successes, Evans was visiting a psychiatrist, as he was unsure whether he wanted to continue as a pianist.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=66}}\n\nEvans left Davis' sextet in November 1958 and stayed with his parents in Florida and his brother in [[Louisiana]]. While he was burned out, one of the main reasons for leaving was his father's illness.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=66}} During this sojourn, the always self-critical Evans suddenly felt his playing had improved. \"While I was staying with my brother in Baton Rouge, I remember finding that somehow I had reached a new level of expression in my playing. It had come almost automatically, and I was very anxious about it, afraid I might lose it.\"{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=66}}\n\nShortly after, he moved back to New York, and in December Evans recorded the trio album ''[[Everybody Digs Bill Evans]]'' for Riverside Records with bassist [[Sam Jones (musician)|Sam Jones]] and drummer Philly Joe Jones. This was Evans's second album as a leader, the first since ''New Jazz Conceptions'', recorded two years earlier. While producer Orrin Keepnews had many times tried to persuade Evans to make a second trio recording, the pianist felt he had nothing new to say&nbsp;... until then. He had also been too busy traveling with Davis to make a record.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=67}}\n\n[[File:Bill Evans Peace Piece.png|thumb|left|Evans built \"Peace Piece\" on a simple one-bar ostinato left-hand figure in C major.

Evans started to play an introduction using an [[ostinato]] figure. However, according to Keepnews, who was present, the pianist spontaneously started to improvise over that harmonic frame, creating the recording that would be named \"Peace Piece\". According to Evans: \"What happened was that I started to play the introduction, and it started to get so much of its own feeling and identity that I just figured, well, I'll keep going.\" However, Gretchen Magee claims that the piece had been penned as an exercise during his college years, while Peri Cousins says that he would often play the piece at home.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nEvans returned to the Davis sextet in early 1959, at the trumpeter's request, to record ''[[Kind of Blue]]'', often considered the best-selling jazz album of all time.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite magazine |last=Light |first=Alan |title=The All-Time 100 Albums |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 2, 2006 |url =http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20061117045106/http://www.time.com/time/2006/100albums/ |url-status =dead |archive-date =November 17, 2006 |access-date=August 19, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{cite magazine |title=500 Greatest Albums of all Time |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |year=2003 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time |access-date=August 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104131142/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/ |archive-date=January 4, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs usual, during the sessions of ''Kind of Blue'', Miles Davis called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. Davis had given the band only sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set about taping the sextet in studio.<ref name=\"KOB notes\" />\n\nDuring the creative process of ''Kind of Blue'', Davis handed Evans a piece of paper with two chords\u2014G minor and A augmented\u2014and asked \"What would you do with that?\" Evans spent the next night writing what would become \"[[Blue in Green]]\".

With this group Evans's focus settled on traditional jazz standards and original compositions, with an added emphasis on interplay among band members. Evans and LaFaro would achieve a high level of musical empathy{{Explain|date=August 2022}}. In December 1959 the band recorded its first album, ''[[Portrait in Jazz]]'' for [[Riverside Records]].\n\nIn early 1960, the trio began a tour that brought them to Boston, San Francisco (at [[Jazz Workshop]]), and Chicago (at the [[Sutherland Hotel|Sutherland Lounge]]). After returning to New York in February, the band performed at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] on a multi-artist bill, and then began a residency at [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland]]. While the trio did not produce any studio records in 1960, two bootleg recordings from radio broadcasts from April and May were illegally released in the early 1970s, which infuriated Evans.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=98\u201399}} Later, they would be posthumously issued as ''The 1960 Birdland Sessions''.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nIn parallel with his trio work, Evans kept working as a backing musician for other bandleaders. In 1960, he performed on singer [[Frank Minion]]'s album ''The Soft Land of Make Believe'', featuring versions of the ''Kind of Blue'' compositions \"Flamenco Sketches\" and \"So What\" with added lyrics. That year, he also recorded ''The Soul of Jazz Percussion'', with Philly Joe Jones and Chambers.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nIn May 1960, the trio performed at one of the Jazz Profiles concerts, a series organized by Charles Schwartz. Around this time, Evans hired [[Monte Kay]] as his manager. During one of his concerts at the Jazz Gallery, Evans contracted [[hepatitis]], and went to his parents' house in Florida to recuperate. During this time period, Evans also participated in the recordings ''[[The Great Kai & J. J.]]'' and ''[[The Incredible Kai Winding Trombones]]'' for [[Impulse! Records]]. In May and August 1960, Evans appeared on George Russell's album ''[[Jazz in the Space Age]].'' In late 1960, he performed on ''Jazz Abstractions'', an album recorded under the leadership of [[Gunther Schuller]] and [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]].<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nEvans' trio with Motian and LaFaro recorded ''[[Explorations (Bill Evans album)|Explorations]]'' in February 1961, the group's second and final studio album. According to Orrin Keepnews, the atmosphere during the recording sessions was tense, Evans and LaFaro having had an argument over extra-musical matters. Additionally, Evans was suffering at the session from headaches, and LaFaro was playing with a loaned bass.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> The disc features the Evans' first trio version of \"Nardis\", the Miles Davis piece Evans had recorded with Cannonball Adderley for Adderley's [[Portrait of Cannonball]] album in 1958. Apart from \"Nardis\" and \"Elsa\", the album consisted of jazz standards. After the recording sessions, Evans was initially unwilling to release the album, believing the trio had played badly. However, upon hearing the recording, he changed his mind, and later thought of it in very positive terms.<ref name=\"interv lafaro\" /> In February 1961, shortly after the ''Explorations'' sessions, he appeared as a sideman in [[Oliver Nelson]]'s ''[[The Blues and the Abstract Truth]]''.\n\nIn late June 1961, Riverside recorded Evans' trio live at the Village Vanguard, which resulted in the albums ''[[Sunday at the Village Vanguard]]'', and ''[[Waltz for Debby (1961 album)|Waltz for Debby]].''

In 1963, at the beginning of his association with [[Verve Records|Verve]], he recorded ''[[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]]'', an album which featured overdubbing, layering up to three individual tracks of piano for each song.

His girlfriend Ellaine Schultz was also an addict. Evans habitually had to borrow money from friends, and eventually, his electricity and telephone services were shut down.

Though both were heroin addicts, the musically-trained Evans never let it interfere with his meticulously precise flights of invention while the self-taught Baker became increasingly erratic and inconsistent.}}</ref> On one occasion while injecting heroin, Evans hit a nerve and temporarily disabled it, performing a full week's engagement at the Village Vanguard virtually one-handed.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> During this time, Helen Keane began having an important influence, as she gave significant assistance helping to maintain Evans's career despite his self-destructive lifestyle, and the two developed a strong friendship.<ref name=\"big love\" />\n\nIn summer 1963, Evans and Schultz left their flat in New York and settled in his parents' home in Florida, where, it seems, they quit the habit for some time.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Even though never legally married, Bill and Ellaine were, in all other respects, husband and wife. At that time, Schultz meant everything to Evans, and was the only person with whom he felt genuine comfort.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nAlthough he recorded many albums for Verve, their artistic quality has typically been viewed as uneven. Despite Israels' fast development and the creativity of new drummer [[Larry Bunker]], the album ''[[Bill Evans Trio with Symphony Orchestra]]'', featuring [[Gabriel Faur\u00e9]]'s ''[[Pavane (Faur\u00e9)|Pavane]]'' and works of other classical composers arranged by [[Claus Ogerman]], divided critical opinion. Some recordings in unusual contexts were made, such as a concert recording with a big-band recorded at [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]], New York that was never issued owing to Evans's dissatisfaction with it (although the more successful jazz trio portion of the concert was [[Bill Evans at Town Hall|released]]). Live recordings and bootleg radio broadcasts from this time period represent some of the trio's better work.\n\nIn 1965, the trio with Chuck Israels and Larry Bunker went on a well-received European tour.\n\n=== Bill Evans meets Eddie G\u00f3mez ===\nIn 1966, Bill Evans met Puerto-Rico born, [[Juilliard]]-graduated bassist [[Eddie G\u00f3mez (musician)|Eddie G\u00f3mez]]. In what turned out to be an eleven-year stay, G\u00f3mez sparked new developments in Evans's trio conception. One of the most significant releases during this period is ''[[Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival]]'' (1968), which won him his second Grammy award.<ref name=\"grammys\" /> It has remained a critical favorite, and is one of two albums Evans made with drummer [[Jack DeJohnette]].\n\nOther highlights from this period include \"Solo \u2013 In Memory of His Father\" from ''[[Bill Evans at Town Hall]]'' (1966), which also introduced \"Turn Out the Stars\"; a second pairing with guitarist Jim Hall, ''[[Intermodulation (album)|Intermodulation]]'' (1966); and the solo album ''[[Alone (Bill Evans album)|Alone]]'' (1968, featuring a 14-minute version of \"Never Let Me Go\"), that won his third Grammy award.<ref name=\"grammys\" />\n\nIn 1968, drummer [[Marty Morell]] joined the trio and remained until 1975, when he retired to family life. This was Evans's most stable, longest-lasting group. Evans had overcome his heroin habit and was entering a period of personal stability.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1970, Evans recorded ''[[From Left to Right]]'', featuring his first use of electric piano.\n\nBetween May and June 1971, Evans recorded ''[[The Bill Evans Album]]'', which won two Grammy awards.<ref name=\"grammys\" /> This all-originals album (four new), also featured alternation between acoustic and electric piano. One of these was \"Comrade Conrad\", a tune that had originated as a [[Crest toothpaste]] jingle and had later been reelaborated and dedicated to Conrad Mendenhall, a friend who had died in a car accident.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=205}}\n\nOther albums included ''[[The Tokyo Concert]]'' (1973); ''[[Since We Met]]'' (1974); and ''[[But Beautiful (Stan Getz & Bill Evans album)|But Beautiful]]'' (1974; released in 1996), featuring the trio plus saxophonist [[Stan Getz]] in live performances from the Netherlands and Belgium. Morell was an energetic, straight-ahead drummer, unlike many of the trio's former percussionists, and many critics feel that this was a period of little growth for Evans. After Morell left, Evans and G\u00f3mez recorded two duo albums, ''[[Intuition (Bill Evans album)|Intuition]]'' and ''[[Montreux III]]''.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Evans was caught at New York's [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] with a suitcase containing heroin. Although the police put him in jail for the night, he was not charged. However, both he and Ellaine had to begin [[methadone]] treatment.<ref name=\"big love\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/08/interview-laurie-verchomin-pt-5.html |title=Interview: Laurie Verchomin (Pt. 5) |publisher=JazzWax |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=June 11, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171456/http://www.jazzwax.com/2009/08/interview-laurie-verchomin-pt-5.html |archive-date=July 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while working in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], California, Evans met and fell in love with Nenette Zazzara, despite his long-term relationship with Ellaine Schultz.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> When Evans broke the news to Schultz she pretended to understand but then committed suicide by throwing herself under a subway train. Evans's relatives believe that Schultz's infertility, coupled with Bill's desire to have a son, may have influenced those events.<ref name=\"2broth\" /> As a result, Evans went back on heroin for a while before resuming methadone treatment. In August 1973, Evans married Nenette, and, in 1975, they had a child, [[Evan Evans (film composer)|Evan]]. The new family, which also included Evans's stepdaughter Maxine, lived in a large house in [[Closter, New Jersey|Closter]], New Jersey.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Both remained very close until his death.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Nenette and Bill remained married until Evans's death in 1980.\n\nIn 1974, Bill Evans recorded a multimovement jazz concerto written for him by [[Claus Ogerman]] entitled ''Symbiosis''.\n\n=== Collaboration with Tony Bennett ===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quoted = 1\n| quote = There is an intriguing juxtaposition of opposites running through the music\u2014Bennett the expansive, heart on sleeve, vibrato man, Evans the inward looking aesthete\u2014which makes for charged listening, if charged is an adjective which can be applied to something so relaxed.

The two musicians had mutual respect for each other's talent. Bennett and Evans performed together for about two years. Although Evans was using cocaine regularly during this period, he was reported sober when recording the albums with Bennett.<ref name=\"Bennett/Evans\"/>\n\nBoth Bennett and Evans stated that it was not just a singer with accompanist affair, but rather a mutually stimulated creative effort to enhance some well known hits with a new twist on familiar melodies and harmonies. Harmonically sophisticated piano arrangements by Evans and his extended piano solos were encouraged by Bennett to emphasize equally valuable input from both musicians.\nBennett and Evans recorded the first album in four studio sessions in June 1975, and the second album in four studio sessions in September 1976. Between the two recordings, Bennett and Evans performed live as a duo, featuring songs from their recordings including \"[[But Beautiful (song)|But Beautiful]]\", \"[[Days of Wine and Roses (song)|Days of Wine and Roses]]\", \"[[Dream Dancing (Cole Porter song)|Dream Dancing]]\".\n\n=== Last years ===\nIn 1975, Morell was replaced by drummer [[Eliot Zigmund]]. Several collaborations followed, and it was not until 1977 that the trio was able to record an album together. Both ''[[I Will Say Goodbye]]'' (Evans's last album for [[Fantasy Records]]) and ''[[You Must Believe in Spring (Bill Evans album)|You Must Believe in Spring]]'' (for Warner Bros.) highlighted changes that would become significant in the last stage of Evans's life. A greater emphasis was placed on group improvisation and interaction, and new harmonic experiments were attempted.\n\n[[File:Bill Evans.jpg|thumb|left|Evans performing at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] with his trio consisting of [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]], bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]], drums, July 13, 1978.]]\nG\u00f3mez and Zigmund left Evans in 1978. Evans then asked Philly Joe Jones, the drummer he considered his \"all-time favorite drummer\", to fill in. Several bassists were tried, with [[Michael Moore (bassist)|Michael Moore]] staying the longest. Evans finally settled on [[Marc Johnson (musician)|Marc Johnson]] on bass and [[Joe LaBarbera]] on drums. This trio would be Evans's last.\nIn April 1979, Evans met Laurie Verchomin, a Canadian waitress (later, a writer) with whom he had a relationship until his death. Verchomin was 28 years younger.<ref name=\"big love\" />\n\nAt the beginning of a several-week tour of the trio through the Pacific Northwest in the spring of 1979, Evans learned that his brother, Harry, who had been diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], had died by suicide at age\n52.<ref name=\"2broth\" /><ref name=\"Allmus\" /><ref name=\"big love\" /> This news shocked him deeply, and some of the concerts had to be canceled.

He started with one gram per weekend, but later started taking several grams daily.<ref name=\"big love\" /> His brother Harry's suicide may have also influenced his emotional state after 1979.

Bridge of the first chorus of \"Waltz for Debby\" (mm.33\u201336). From the 1961 album of the same name.]]\n\nOne of Evans's distinctive harmonic traits is excluding the root in his chords, leaving this work to the bassist, played on another beat of the measure, or just left implied. \"If I am going to be sitting here playing roots, fifths and full voicings, the bass is relegated to a time machine.\" This idea had already been explored by [[Ahmad Jamal]], [[Erroll Garner]], and [[Red Garland]]. In Evans's system, the chord is expressed as a quality identity and a color.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=4}} Most of Evans's harmonies feature added note chords or [[Quartal and quintal harmony|quartal]] voicings.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=40}} Thus, Evans created a self-sufficient language for the left hand, a distinctive voicing, that allowed the transition from one chord to the next while hardly having to move the hand. With this technique, he created an effect of continuity in the central register of the piano. Lying around middle C, in this region the harmonic clusters sounded the clearest, and at the same time, left room for contrapuntal independence with the bass.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nEvans's improvisations relied heavily on motivic development, either melodically or rhythmically.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=40}} Motives may be broken and recombined to form melodies.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=41}}  Another characteristic of Evans's style is rhythmic displacement.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=42}} His melodic contours often describe arches.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=43}} Other characteristics include sequenciation of melodies and transforming one motive into another.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=43}} He plays with one hand in the time signature of 4/4 and the other momentarily in 3/4.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=46}}\n\nAt the beginning of his career, Evans used block chords heavily. He later abandoned them in part.{{sfn|Valerio|2005|p=49}}\nDuring a 1978 interview, [[Marian McPartland]] asked:\n: \"How do you think your playing has changed since you first started?

I used to use a lot of finger technique when I was younger, and I changed over to a weight technique. Actually, if you play Bach and the voices sing at all, and sustain the way they should, you really can't play it with the wrong approach.\"{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=39}} Evans valued Bach's \"[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]\" and his \"[[Inventions and Sinfonias (Bach)|Two- and Three-Part Inventions]]\" as excellent practice material.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}\n\nIn an interview with Len Lyons, Evans said, \"for me, technique is the ability to translate your ideas into sound through your instrument.\"<ref>Lyons, Len, ''The Great Jazz Pianists'', Da Capo Press (1983), p. 224.</ref>\n\n=== Influences ===\n\nIn an interview given in 1964, Evans described [[Bud Powell]] as his single greatest influence.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       =The Complete Bud Powell on Verve\n| year        =1994\n| last        =Evans\n| first       =Bill\n| first2      =Randi\n| last2       =Hultin\n| page        =39\n| type        =Liner notes, booklet\n| publisher   =Verve\n}}</ref> Biographer Peter Pettinger notes that Evans \"assimilated 'a thousand influences,'\" including pianists such as [[Dave Brubeck]], [[George Shearing]], [[Oscar Peterson]], [[Al Haig]], and [[Lou Levy (pianist)|Lou Levy]] as well as horn players such as [[Miles Davis]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], and [[Stan Getz]]. \"The biggest influence on Evans [in his early days], though, was the pianism of Nat 'King' Cole,\" whom Evans called \"one of the tastiest and just swingin'est and beautifully melodic improvisers and jazz pianists that jazz has ever known, and he was one of the very first that really grabbed me hard.\"{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=14\u201315}} Pettinger also notes that the \"work of the pianist [[Lennie Tristano]], with his cool approach to a line\" was an important influence on Evans,{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=34}} and Lyons observes that Tristano preceded Evans in his use of overdubbing piano tracks.<ref>Lyons, p. 220</ref> In addition, Evans was heavily influenced by his in-depth studies of European classical music: \"The constructional knowledge of music that Evans later brought to jazz was firmly rooted in this European tradition, as was his thoroughly trained and exquisitely refined touch at the keyboard.\"{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=16}}\n\nAs a composer, Evans also assimilated and amalgamated jazz, popular, and classical influences in an \"utterly logical\" manner.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=129}} His compositional style shows similarities to and influences from some of the composers whose works he often played, such as [[Earl Zindars]]{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=129}} and [[Michel Legrand]].{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=243}} J.

During this decade, jazz was swept into a corner, and most new talents had few opportunities to gain recognition, especially in America.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=197}} However, Evans believed he had been lucky to gain some exposure before this profound change in the music world, and never had problems gaining bookings and recording opportunities.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=197}}\n\nEvans never embraced new music movements; he kept his style intact. For example, he lamented watching Davis shift his style towards [[jazz fusion]] and blamed the change on considerations of commerce. Evans commented, \"I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master [Davis], but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience. It happens more and more these days, that unqualified people with executive positions try to tell musicians what is good and what is bad music.\"<ref name=milesbill /> However, Evans and Davis kept in touch throughout their lives.<ref name=\"big love\" />\n\nWhile Evans considered himself an acoustic pianist, from the 1970 album ''[[From Left to Right]]'' on, he also released some material with [[Fender-Rhodes]] piano intermissions. However, unlike other jazz players (such as [[Herbie Hancock]]) he never fully embraced the new instrument, and invariably ended up returning to the acoustic sound. \"I don't think too much about the electronic thing, except that it's kind of fun to have it as an alternate voice.&nbsp;... [It's] merely an alternate keyboard instrument, that offers a certain kind of sound that's appropriate sometimes. I find that it's a refreshing auxiliary to the piano\u2014but I don't need it&nbsp;... I don't enjoy spending a lot of time with the electric piano. I play it for a period of time, then I quickly tire of it, and I want to get back to the acoustic piano.\"<ref name=\"milesbill\" /> He commented that electronic music: \"just doesn't attract me. I'm of a certain period, a certain evolution. I hear music differently. For me, comparing electric bass to acoustic bass is sacrilege.\"<ref name=\"milesbill\" />\n\n== Repertoire and compositions ==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Bill Evans}}\nEvans's repertoire consisted of established [[jazz standards]], songs by contemporaries (some of which he helped become standards), and original compositions (some of which have also gone on to become standards). Among the major American songwriters, he was particularly drawn to the work of [[Jimmy Van Heusen]], recording what was reputedly his favorite song, \"[[But Beautiful (song)|But Beautiful]],\"{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=261}} many times in various settings as well as many other tunes by Van Heusen. Contemporaries whose works he often played include [[Michel Legrand]], [[Johnny Mandel]], and [[Earl Zindars]] as well as, to a lesser extent, [[Burt Bacharach]], [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], [[Henry Mancini]], [[Gary McFarland]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Claus Ogerman]], [[Steve Swallow]], and [[Denny Zeitlin]]. Other songs by his contemporaries and colleagues he recorded include \"[[In Your Own Sweet Way]]\" by [[Dave Brubeck]], \"[[You're Gonna Hear from Me (song)|You're Gonna Hear from Me]]\" by [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]], \"[[The Peacocks (album)|The Peacocks]]\" by Jimmy Rowles, \"[[Dolphin Dance]]\" by [[Herbie Hancock]], and, atypically, \"[[I Do It for Your Love]]\" by [[Paul Simon]], which nonetheless \"continued to inspire the pianist's most complex thoughts\" in his final years.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=282}} \"[[Nardis (composition)|Nardis]]\" by [[Miles Davis]] was a special signature tune, often performed in highly extended versions by his final trio.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=267}}\n\nDuring a radio interview, [[Marian McPartland]] listened to Evans play \"Reflections in D\" by [[Duke Ellington]] and later noted, \"Sitting next to him, listening to the rise and fall of the melody, I realized that ... he chooses some of the most romantic, evocative tunes there are. The tune ended softly with a chord so perfect it took my breath away.\"<ref>Marian McPartland, liner notes to ''Bill Evans: Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz'', The Jazz Alliance, Inc., 1993.</ref>\n\nEvans composed over 50 originals. Many were dedicated to people close to him. Some known examples include \"Waltz for Debby\" for his niece; \"For Nenette\" for his wife; \"Letter to Evan\" for his son; \"NYC's No Lark,\" an anagram of [[Sonny Clark]] in memory of his friend the pianist; \"Re: Person I Knew,\" another anagram, of the name of his friend and producer [[Orrin Keepnews]]; \"We Will Meet Again\" for his brother; \"Peri's Scope\" for girlfriend Peri Cousins; \"One for Helen\" and \"Song for Helen\" for his manager Helen Keane; \"B minor Waltz (For Ellaine)\" for girlfriend Ellaine Schultz; \"Laurie\" for girlfriend Laurie Verchomin; \"Yet Ne'er Broken,\" an anagram of the name of cocaine dealer Robert Kenney; \"Maxine\" for his stepdaughter; \"Tiffany\" for Joe LaBarbera's daughter; and \"Knit For Mary F.\" for fan Mary Franksen from [[Omaha]].{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=276}}\n\n== Personal life ==\nBill Evans was an avid reader, in particular philosophy and humorous books. His shelves held works by [[Plato]], [[Voltaire]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[George Santayana|Santayana]], [[Freud]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Sartre]] and [[Thomas Merton]]; and he had a special fondness for [[Thomas Hardy]]'s work. He was fascinated with Eastern religions and philosophies including [[Islam]], [[Zen]], and [[Buddhism]]. It was Evans who introduced [[John Coltrane]] to the Indian philosophy of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti]].<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\nEvans liked to paint and draw.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|p=66}} He was also a keen golfer, a hobby that began on his father's golf course.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Evans had a fondness for horse racing and frequently gambled hundreds of dollars, often winning.{{sfn|Pettinger|2002|pp=66\u201367}} During his last years, he even owned a racehorse named \"Annie Hall\" with producer [[Jack Rollins (producer)|Jack Rollins]].<ref name=\"big love\" />\n\nIn 1973, Evans broke up with his girlfriend of twelve years, Ellaine Schultz, to pursue Nenette Zazzara. Schultz then committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a subway train.\n\nEvans married Zazzara in August 1973. They met while Bill's trio was performing at Howard Rumsey's club Concerts By The Sea in Redondo Beach, California, where Zazzara was a part-time waitress.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Guthrie |first1=Bruce |title=Nenette Evans: My Life With Bill |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/nenette-evans-my-life-with-bill-bill-evans-by-bruce-guthrie |website=All About Jazz |access-date=12 May 2023 |language=en |date=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Bill-Evans-1964.jpg|thumb|right|Evans in [[Helsinki]] in 1964.]]\nMusic critic Richard S.

Evans later acknowledged that some felt his presence threatened the black pride aspect of the famed Davis band's success.  Pettinger believed in a recording, for his solo on a tune named \"Walkin'\", Evans received noticeably less applause than the other soloists, and for that on \"All Of You\", none at all.  Davis and the other band members would respond \"he's supposed to be there, Miles wants him there\" on the bandstand whenever audience members made comments.<ref name=\"pettinger\" /> Davis noted in his autobiography that Evans was sensitive to the criticism and let it get to him. This might have been a contributing factor to Evans leaving the band after just seven months.\n\nWhen Ken Burns' television miniseries [[Jazz (TV series)|''Jazz'']] was released in 2001, it was criticised for neglecting Evans's work after his departure from the Miles Davis' sextet.<ref name=\"pettinger\" />\n\n== Legacy and influence ==\nAuthor and jazz pianist Len Lyons wrote: \"Evans was the most influential pianist of the 1960's.
