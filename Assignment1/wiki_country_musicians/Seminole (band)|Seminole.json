Today, they live in [[Oklahoma]] and Florida, and comprise three [[federally recognized tribes]]: the [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]], the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]], and the [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]], as well as independent groups. The Seminole people emerged in a process of [[ethnogenesis]] from various Native American groups who settled in [[Spanish Florida]] beginning in the early 1700s, most significantly northern [[Muscogee|Muscogee Creeks]] from what are now [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]].{{sfn|Mahon|Weisman|1996|pages=183-187}}\n\nOld crafts and traditions were revived in both Florida and Oklahoma in the mid-20th century as the Seminole began seeking revenue from tourists traveling along the new [[interstate highway system]]. In the 1970s, Seminole tribes began to run small [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]] games on their reservations to raise revenue. They won court challenges to initiate [[Native American gaming|Indian gaming]] on their sovereign land. Many U.S. tribes have likewise adopted this practice where state laws have gambling, in order to generate revenues for welfare, education, and development.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] has been particularly successful with gambling establishments, attracting many of the numerous tourists to the state. In 2007 it  purchased the [[Hard Rock Caf\u00e9]] and has rebranded or opened several [[casino]]s and gaming resorts under that name. These include two large resorts on its [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]] reservations; together these projects cost more than a billion dollars to construct.<ref name=\"hardrock\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/biz-monday/article79172817.html |title=How the Seminole Tribe came to rock the Hard Rock empire |last=Herrera |first=Chabeli |date=27 May 2016 |work=The Miami Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cridlin |first1=Jay |title=We went inside Seminole Hard Rock's $720 million Tampa expansion |url=https://www.tampabay.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/01/we-went-inside-seminole-hard-rocks-720-million-tampa-expansion/ |access-date=June 8, 2021 |work=Tampa Bay Times |date=October 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and culture ==\nThe word \"Seminole\" is almost certainly derived from the Creek word ''siman\u00f3-li''.

However, the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases, along with conflict with Spanish colonists, led to a [[Population history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|drastic decline]] of Florida's original native population. By the early 1700s, much of ''La Florida'' was uninhabited apart from Spanish colonial towns at [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. A stream of mainly [[Muscogee|Muscogee Creek]] began moving into the territory at that time to escape conflict with English colonists to the north and established their own towns, mainly in the Florida panhandle.\n\nNative American refugees from northern wars, such as the [[Yuchi]] and [[Yamasee]] after the [[Yamasee War]] in South Carolina, migrated into [[Spanish Florida]] in the early 18th century. More arrived in the second half of the 18th century, as the Lower [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creeks]], part of the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Muscogee]] people, began to migrate from several of their towns into Florida to evade the dominance of the Upper Creeks and pressure from encroaching colonists from the [[Province of Carolina]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hawkins|first=Philip Colin|title=The Textual Archaeology of Seminole Colonization|journal=Florida Anthropologist|date=June 2011|volume=64|issue=2|pages=107\u2013113}}</ref> They spoke primarily [[Hitchiti]], of which [[Mikasuki]] is a dialect.

The native population had been devastated by infectious diseases brought by Spanish explorers in the 1500s and later colonization by additional European settlers. Later, raids by [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] and Native American slavers destroyed the [[Spanish missions in Florida|string of Spanish missions across northern Florida]]. Most of the survivors left for Cuba when the Spanish withdrew, after ceding Florida to the British in 1763, following Britain's victory in the [[French and Indian War]]. \n\nWhile [[John Swanton]] stated in the mid-20th century that the Seminole encountered and absorbed the Calusa who had remained in southwest Florida after the Spanish withdrew, more recent scholarship since the turn of the 21st century holds that there is no documentary evidence of that assertion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Swanton |first1=John |title=The Indian Tribes of North America |date=1952 |url=https://repository.si.edu/handle/10088/15440 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0874741793 |pages=125\u2013128|hdl=10088/15440 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=MacMahon |first1=Darcie A. |last2=Marquardt |first2=William H. |year=2004 |title=The Calusa and Their Legacy: South Florida People and Their Environments |publisher=University Press of Florida |location=Gainesville, Florida |pages=118\u2013121 |isbn=0-8130-2773-X}}</ref>\n\n===1700s to early 1800s===\nAs they established themselves in northern and peninsular Florida throughout the 1700s, the various new arrivals intermingled with each other and with the few remaining indigenous people.

At that time, numerous refugees of the [[Red Sticks]] migrated south, adding about 2,000 people to the population. They were Creek-speaking Muscogee, and were the ancestors of most of the later Creek-speaking Seminole.<ref>Sturtevant and Cattelino (2004), p.432</ref> In addition, a few hundred escaped African-American slaves (known as the [[Black Seminoles]]) had settled near the Seminole towns and, to a lesser extent, Native Americans from other tribes, and some white Americans. The unified Seminole spoke two languages: Creek and Mikasuki (mutually intelligible with its dialect [[Hitchiti]]),<ref>Hardy, Heather & Janine Scancarelli. (2005). ''Native Languages of the Southeastern United States,'' Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press, pp. 69-70</ref> two among the [[Muskogean languages]] family. Creek became the dominant language for political and social discourse, so Mikasuki speakers learned it if participating in high-level negotiations. The Muskogean language group includes [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]], associated with two other major Southeastern tribes.\n\nIn part due to the arrival of Native Americans from other cultures, the Seminole became increasingly independent of other Creek groups and established their own identity through [[ethnogenesis]]. They developed a thriving trade network by the time of the [[British Florida|British]] and second Spanish periods (roughly 1767\u20131821).{{sfn|Mahon|Weisman|1996|pages=187-189}} The tribe expanded considerably during this time, and was further supplemented from the late 18th century by [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|escaped slaves]] from [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|Southern plantations]] who settled near and paid tribute to Seminole towns. The latter became known as [[Black Seminoles]], although they kept many facets of their own [[Gullah]] culture.{{sfn|Mahon|Weisman|1996|pages=190-191}}\n\nDuring the colonial years, the Seminole were on relatively good terms with both the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]. In 1784, after the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain came to a settlement with Spain and transferred East and West Florida to it. \n\nThe [[Spanish Empire]]'s decline enabled the Seminole to settle more deeply into Florida. They were led by a dynasty of chiefs of the [[Alachua culture|Alachua]] chiefdom, founded in eastern Florida in the 18th century by [[Cowkeeper]]. Beginning in 1825, [[Micanopy]] was the principal chief of the unified Seminole, until his death in 1849, after removal to Indian Territory.<ref name=\"Sattler-p461\">Sattler (2004), p. 461</ref> This chiefly [[dynasty]] lasted past Removal, when the US forced the majority of Seminole to move from Florida to the [[Indian Territory]] (modern Oklahoma) after the [[Second Seminole War]].

The Seminoles also maintained a tradition of accepting [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|escaped slaves]] from [[Plantation complexes in the Southern United States|Southern plantations]], infuriating [[Planter class|planters]] in the American South by providing a route for their slaves to escape bondage.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Osceola and the Great Seminole War|last=Hatch|first=Thom|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2012|location=New York|pages=34\u201370}}</ref>\n\nAfter the United States achieved independence, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and local militia groups made increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish Florida to recapture escaped slaves living among the Seminole.

They promised lands west of the [[Mississippi River]] if the chiefs agreed to leave Florida voluntarily with their people. The Seminoles who remained prepared for war. White colonists continued to press for their removal.\n\nIn 1835, the U.S. Army arrived to enforce the treaty. The Seminole leader [[Osceola]] led the vastly outnumbered resistance during the [[Second Seminole War]]. Drawing on a population of about 4,000 Seminoles and 800 allied Black Seminoles, he mustered at most 1,400 warriors (President Andrew Jackson estimated they had only 900). They countered combined U.S. Army and militia forces that ranged from 6,000 troops at the outset to 9,000 at the peak of deployment in 1837. To survive, the Seminole allies employed [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] with devastating effect against U.S. forces, as they knew how to move within the Everglades and use this area for their protection. Osceola was arrested (in a breach of honor) when he came under a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to negotiations with the US in 1837. He died in jail less than a year later. He was decapitated, his body buried without his head.\n\nOther war chiefs, such as [[Halleck Tustenuggee]] and John Jumper, and the Black Seminoles [[Abraham]] and [[John Horse]], continued the Seminole resistance against the army. After a full decade of fighting, the war ended in 1842. Scholars estimate the U.S. government spent about $40,000,000 on the war, at the time a huge sum. An estimated 3,000 Seminoles and 800 Black Seminoles were forcibly exiled to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi, where they were settled on the Creek reservation. After later skirmishes in the [[Seminole Wars#Third Seminole War|Third Seminole War]] (1855\u20131858), perhaps 200 survivors retreated deep into the [[Everglades]] to land that was not desired by settlers.

The Florida Seminoles founded a high-stakes bingo game on their reservation in the late 1970s, winning court challenges to initiate [[Native American gaming]], which many tribes have adopted to generate revenues for welfare, education, and development.\n\nAfter removal, the Seminoles in Oklahoma and Florida had little official contact until well into the 20th century. They developed along similar lines as the groups strove to maintain their culture while struggling economically. Most Seminoles in Indian Territory lived on tribal lands centered in what is now [[Seminole County, Oklahoma|Seminole County]] of the state of Oklahoma. The implementation of the [[Dawes Rolls]] in the late 1890s parceled out tribal lands in preparation for the admission of Oklahoma as a state, reducing most Seminoles to [[subsistence farming]] on small individual homesteads. While some tribe members left the territory to seek better opportunities, most remained. Today, residents of the reservation are enrolled in the federally recognized [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]], while others belong to unorganized groups. The Florida Seminole re-established limited relations with the U.S. government in the early 1900s and were officially granted {{convert|5000|acre|km2}} of reservation land in south Florida in 1930. Members gradually moved to the land, and they reorganized their government and received federal recognition as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] in 1957. The more traditional people living near the [[Tamiami Trail]] received federal recognition as the [[Miccosukee]] Tribe in 1962.{{sfn|Mahon|Weisman|1996|pages=203-204}}\n\n==Political and social organization==\nThe Seminoles were organized around ''it\u00e1lwa'', the basis of their social, political and ritual systems, and roughly equivalent to towns or bands in English. They had a [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] kinship system, in which children are considered born into their mother's family and clan, and property and hereditary roles pass through the maternal line. Males held the leading political and social positions. Each ''it\u00e1lwa'' had civil, military and religious leaders; they were self-governing throughout the nineteenth century, but would cooperate for mutual defense. The ''it\u00e1lwa'' continued to be the basis of Seminole society in Oklahoma into the 21st century.<ref>Sattler (2004), p. 459</ref>\n\n==Languages==\nHistorically, the various groups of Seminoles spoke two mutually unintelligible [[Muskogean languages]]: [[Mikasuki language|Mikasuki]] (and its dialect, Hitchiti) and [[Muscogee language|Muscogee]]. Mikasuki is now restricted to Florida, where it was the native language of 1,600 people as of 2000, primarily the [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]]. The [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] is working to revive the use of Creek among its people, as it had been the dominant language of politics and social discourse.<ref name=Sturtevant/>\n\nMuscogee is spoken by some Oklahoma Seminoles and about 200 older Florida Seminoles. The youngest native speaker was born in 1960. Today, English is the predominant language among both Oklahoma and Florida Seminoles, particularly the younger generations. Most Mikasuki speakers are bilingual.<ref name=Sturtevant/>\n\n==Ethnobotany==\nThe Seminole use the spines of [[Cirsium horridulum]] (also called bristly thistle) to make blowgun darts.<ref>Sturtevant, William, 1954, ''The Mikasuki Seminole: Medical Beliefs and Practices'', Yale University, PhD Thesis, page 507</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Seminole music}}\n\n==Contemporary==\n[[File:A Seminole Woman.jpg|upright|thumb| Seminole woman, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\nDuring the Seminole Wars, the Seminole people began to divide among themselves due to the conflict and differences in ideology. The Seminole population had also been growing significantly, though it was diminished by the wars.<ref name=\"seminoletribe.com\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.semtribe.com/History/\n|title=Seminole History\n|publisher=Seminole Tribe of Florida\n|access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref> With the division of the Seminole population between Indian Territory (Oklahoma) and Florida, they still maintained some common traditions, such as powwow trails and ceremonies. In general, the cultures grew apart in their markedly different circumstances, and had little contact for a century.\n\nThe [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]], and the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]] and [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]], described below, are federally recognized, independent nations that operate in their own spheres.<ref name=c41>Cattelino, p. 41.</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nSeminole tribes generally follow Christianity, both [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. They also observe their [[Native American religion|traditional Native religion]], which is expressed through the [[stomp dance]] and the [[Green Corn Ceremony]] held at their ceremonial grounds. [[Indigenous peoples]] have practiced Green Corn rituals for centuries. Contemporary southeastern Native American tribes, such as the Seminole and [[Muscogee Creek]], still practice these ceremonies. As converted Christian Seminoles established their own churches, they incorporated their traditions and beliefs into a syncretic indigenous-Western practice.<ref>Clark, pp. 750, 752.</ref> For example, Seminole hymns sung in the indigenous (Muscogee) language are inclusive of key Muscogee language terms (for example, the Muscogee term ''\"mekko\"'' or chief conflates with \"Jesus\"). Also, hymns are frequently led by a song leader (a traditional indigenous song practice).<ref>Taborn, pp. 27, 74.</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, federal projects in Florida encouraged the tribe's reorganization. They created organizations within tribal governance to promote modernization. As Christian pastors began preaching on reservations, Green Corn Ceremony attendance decreased. This created tension between religiously traditional Seminoles and those who began adopting Christianity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Neill |first1=Wilfred T. |title=The story of Florida's Seminole Indians |date=1956 |publisher=Great Outdoors |location=St. Petersburg, Fla. |isbn=9780820010182 |page=85 |edition=2d}}</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s, some tribal members on reservations, such as the [[Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation]] in Florida, viewed organized Christianity as a threat to their traditions.\n\nBy the 1980s, Seminole communities were even more concerned about loss of language and tradition. Many tribal members began to revive the observance of traditional Green Corn Dance ceremonies, and some shifted away from Christian observance. By 2000, religious tension between Green Corn Dance attendees and Christians (particularly Baptists) decreased. Some Seminole families participate in both religions; these practitioners have developed a syncretic Christianity that has absorbed some tribal traditions.<ref>Cattelino, pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n==Land claims==\nIn 1946, the Department of Interior established the [[Indian Claims Commission]], to consider compensation for tribes that claimed their lands were seized by the federal government during times of conflict. Tribes seeking settlements had to file claims by August 1961, and both the Oklahoma and Florida Seminoles did so.<ref name=\"claim\">[https://archive.today/20130909220329/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19781020&id=XTYeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Nr8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=4601,1746657 Bill Drummond, \"Indian Land Claims Unsettled 150 Years After Jackson Wars\"], ''LA Times''/''Washington Post'' News Service, printed in ''Sarasota Herald-Tribune,'' 20 October 1978, accessed 13 April 2013</ref> After combining their claims, the Commission awarded the Seminole a total of $16 million in April 1976. It had established that, at the time of the 1823 [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], the Seminole exclusively occupied and used 24 million acres in Florida, which they ceded under the treaty.<ref name=\"claim\"/> Assuming that most blacks in Florida were escaped slaves, the United States did not recognize the Black Seminoles as legally members of the tribe, nor as free in Florida under Spanish rule. Although the Black Seminoles also owned or controlled land that was seized in this cession, they were not acknowledged in the treaty.\n\nIn 1976, the groups struggled on allocation of funds among the Oklahoma and Florida tribes. Based on early 20th century population records, at which time most of the people were full-blood, the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma was to receive three-quarters of the judgment and the Florida peoples one-quarter. The Miccosukee and allied Traditionals filed suit against the settlement in 1976 to refuse the money; they did not want to give up their claim for return of lands in Florida.<ref name=\"claim\"/>\n\nThe federal government put the settlement in trust until the court cases could be decided. The Oklahoma and Florida tribes entered negotiations, which was their first sustained contact in the more than a century since removal. In 1990, the settlement was awarded: three-quarters to the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma and one-quarter to the Seminoles of Florida, including the Miccosukee. By that time the total settlement was worth $40 million.<ref>Sturtevant, pp. 454-455</ref> The tribes have set up judgment trusts, which fund programs to benefit their people, such as education and health.\n\n{{main|Seminole Nation of Oklahoma}}\nAs a result of the Second Seminole War (1835\u20131842), about 3,800 Seminoles and Black Seminoles were forcibly removed to [[Indian Territory]] (the modern state of [[Oklahoma]]).<ref name=CATTY/> During the American Civil War, the members and leaders split over their loyalties, with [[John Chupco]] refusing to sign a treaty with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. From 1861 to 1866, he led as chief of the Seminole who supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and fought in the Indian Brigade.\n\nThe split among the Seminoles lasted until 1872. After the war, the United States government negotiated only with the loyal Seminole, requiring the tribe to make a new peace treaty to cover those who allied with the Confederacy, to emancipate the [[Slavery|slaves]], and to extend tribal citizenship to those [[freedmen]] who chose to stay in Seminole territory.\n\nThe [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] now has about 16,000 enrolled members, who are divided into a total of fourteen bands; for the Seminole members, these are similar to tribal [[clan]]s. The Seminole have a society based on a [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] kinship system of descent and inheritance: children are born into their mother's band and derive their status from her people. To the end of the nineteenth century, they spoke mostly Mikasuki and Creek.\n\nTwo of the fourteen are \"Freedmen Bands,\" composed of members descended from Black Seminoles, who were legally freed by the U.S. and tribal nations after the Civil War. They have a tradition of extended patriarchal families in close communities. While the elite interacted with the Seminoles, most of the Freedmen were involved most closely with other Freedmen. They maintained their own culture, religion and social relationships. At the turn of the 20th century, they still spoke mostly [[Afro-Seminole Creole]], a language developed in Florida related to other African-based Creole languages.\n\nThe Nation is ruled by an elected council, with two members from each of the fourteen bands, including the Freedmen's bands. The capital is at [[Wewoka, Oklahoma]].\n\nThe [[Seminole Nation of Oklahoma]] has had tribal citizenship disputes related to the Seminole Freedmen, both in terms of their sharing in a judgment trust awarded in settlement of a land claim suit, and their membership in the Nation.<ref name=CATTY/>\n\n===Florida Seminoles===\n[[File:Seminole family Cypress Tiger.jpg|thumb|Seminole family of tribal elder, Cypress Tiger, at their camp near [[Kendall, Florida|Kendall]], Florida, 1916.

Those who accepted reservation lands and made adaptations achieved federal recognition in 1957 as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]].<ref name=\"seminoletribe.com\"/>\n\nMany of those who had kept to traditional ways and spoke the [[Mikasuki language]] organized as the [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]], gaining state recognition in 1957 and federal recognition in 1962. (See also [[#Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida|Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]], below.) With federal recognition, they gained reservation lands and worked out a separate arrangement with the state for control of extensive wetlands.

Natural disasters magnified changes from the governmental drainage project of the Everglades. Residential, agricultural, and business development changed the \"natural, social, political, and economic environment\" of the Seminoles.<ref name=c41/> In the 1930s, the Seminoles slowly began to move onto federally designated reservation lands within the region. The U.S. government had purchased lands and put them in trust for Seminole use.<ref>Cattelino, p. 130.</ref> Initially, few Seminoles had any interest in moving to the reservation land or in establishing more formal relations with the government. Some feared that if they moved onto reservations, they would be forced to move to Oklahoma.

A major catalyst for this was the conversion of many Seminole to Christianity, following missionary effort spearheaded by the Creek [[Baptists|Baptist]] evangelist Stanley Smith. For the new converts, relocating to the reservations afforded them the opportunity to establish their own churches, where they adapted traditions to incorporate into their style of Christianity. Reservation Seminoles began forming tribal governments and forming ties with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].{{sfn|Mahon|Weisman|1996|page=203}} In 1957 the nation reorganized and established formal relations with the U.S. government as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]].<ref name=c41/> The Seminole Tribe of Florida is headquartered in [[Hollywood, Florida]].

They felt disfranchised by the move of the Seminoles to reservations, who they felt were adopting too many European American ways. Their differences were exacerbated in 1950 when some reservation Seminoles filed a land claim suit against the federal government for seizure of lands in the 19th century, an action that the Trail Indians did not support.{{sfn|Mahon|Weisman|1996|pages=203-204}}\n\nFollowing federal recognition of the Seminole Tribe of Florida in 1957, the Trail Indians decided to organize a separate government. They sought recognition as the Miccosukee Tribe, as they spoke the [[Mikasuki language]]. It was not intelligible to Creek speakers, but some members of each group were bilingual in the two languages, especially as the Creek-speaking Seminole were more numerous.\n\nThe [[Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida]] received federal recognition in 1962.

The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) hoped that the cattle raising would teach Seminoles to become citizens by adapting to agricultural settlements. The BIA also hoped that this program would lead to Seminole self-sufficiency. Cattle owners realized that by using their cattle as equity, they could engage in \"new capital-intensive pursuits\", such as housing.<ref>Cattelino, pp. 32 and 34.</ref>\n\nSince then, the two Florida tribes have developed economies based chiefly on sales of duty-free tobacco, heritage and resort tourism, and gaming.
