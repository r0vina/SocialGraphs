Revolutions such as those in [[French Revolution|France]] and [[American Revolution|America]] called for people to begin thinking of themselves as [[citizens]] as opposed to [[Commoner|subjects]] under a king, and thus necessitated flags that represented the collective citizenry, not just the power and right of a ruling family.{{sfn|Nadler|2016}}{{sfn|Inglefield|Mould|1979|p=48}} With [[nationalism]] becoming common across Europe in the 19th century, national flags came to represent most of the states of Europe.{{sfn|Nadler|2016}} Flags also began fostering a sense of unity between different peoples, such as the [[Union Jack]] representing a union between [[England]] and [[Scotland]], or began to represent unity between nations in a perceived shared struggle, for example, the [[Pan-Slavic colors]] or later [[Pan-Arab colors]].{{sfn|Bartlett|2011|p=31}}\n\nAs Europeans [[colonized]] significant portions of the world, they exported ideas of nationhood and national symbols, including flags, with the adoption of a flag becoming seen as integral to the [[nation-building]] process.{{sfn|Virmani|1999|p=169}} Political change, social reform, and revolutions combined with a growing sense of nationhood among ordinary people in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the birth of new nations and flags around the globe.{{sfn|Inglefield|Mould|1979|p=50}} With so many flags being created, interest in these designs began to develop and the study of flags, [[vexillology]], at both professional and amateur levels, emerged.
