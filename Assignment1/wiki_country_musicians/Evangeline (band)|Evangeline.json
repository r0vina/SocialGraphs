The poem follows an [[Acadia]]n girl named Evangeline and her search for her lost love Gabriel during the [[Expulsion of the Acadians]] (1755\u20131764).\n\nThe idea for the poem came from Longfellow's friend [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. Longfellow used [[dactylic hexameter]], imitating Greek and Latin classics. Though the choice was criticized, it became Longfellow's most famous work in his lifetime and remains one of his most popular and enduring works.\n\nThe poem had a powerful effect in defining both Acadian history and identity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It represents lost loved ones and heartbreak but also keeping hope. While Longfellow was a poet, not a historian, twenty-first century scholarship has included those who chose to expound their view that Longfellow's work fails as a scientific historical document.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McKay|first1=Ian|last2=Bates|first2=Robin|title=In the Province of History: The Making of the Public Past in Twentieth-Century Nova Scotia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYyWkA3izIAC&pg=PP1|year=2010|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=978-0-7735-3703-3|jstor=j.ctt81b7b}}<br>\u2022&nbsp;{{cite book|last=Blanc|first=Barbara Le|title=Postcards from Acadie: Grand-Pr\u00e9, Evangeline & The Acadian Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=epvDAAAACAAJ&pg=PP1|edition=2nd|year=2003|publisher=Gaspereau Press|isbn=978-1-894031-69-1}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File: Joseph Rusling Meeker, The Acadians in the Achafalaya, \"Evangeline,\" 1871.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Joseph Rusling Meeker]] (American, 1827\u20131889).

When sending a copy of the poem to [[Bryan Procter]], Longfellow wrote: \"I hope you will not reject it on account of the meter. In fact, I could not write it ''as it is'' in any other; it would have changed its character entirely to have put it into a different measure.\"{{sfnp|Wagenknecht|1966|page=129}} Even Longfellow's wife Fanny defended his choice, writing to a friend: \"It enables greater richness of expression than any other, and it is sonorous like the sea which is ever sounding in Evangeline's ear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  As an experiment, Longfellow reassured himself that he was using the best meter by attempting a passage in blank verse.{{sfnp|Williams|1964|page=151}} Even so, while looking over the [[galley proof|proofs]] for a second edition, Longfellow briefly wished he had used a different poetic structure:\n{{quote|text=It certainly would be a relief to the hexameters to let them stretch their legs a little more at their ease; still for the sake of uniformity I believe they must still sit a while longer with their knees bent under them like travelers in a stage-coach.|author=Edward Wagenknecht|source=''Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: Portrait of an American Humanist''.

Longfellow's poem shed light on the 150 years of Acadian settlement that preceded the establishment of Halifax.{{sfnp|McKay|Bates|2010|pages=40\u201342}}\n\nThe Expulsion was planned and executed by the British and [[New England Colonies|New England]] authorities. Longfellow omitted from the poem New England's involvement in the expulsion. Through his poem, Longfellow defines America as a place of refuge for the exiled Acadians.{{sfnp|McKay|Bates|2010|pages=40\u201342}} Longfellow's account was later challenged by historian [[Francis Parkman]], in his book ''[[Montcalm and Wolfe]]'' (1884). Parkman claimed the real reason for the expulsion was the \"influence\" held by the French over the Acadians, particularly by Abb\u00e9 [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]].{{sfnp|McKay|Bates|2010|pages=39, 99}} American historian John Brebner eventually wrote ''New England's Outpost'' (1927), which identified how instrumental New Englanders were in the expulsion of the Acadians.{{sfnp|McKay|Bates|2010|pages=40\u201342}}<ref>John Brebner. ''Acadia before the conquest of Canada''. Columbia University Press. 1927.</ref>\n\nThe poem had a powerful impact in defining both Acadian history and identity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. More recent scholarship has revealed both the historical misconceptions in the poem and the complexity of the Expulsion and those involved, which the poem obscures.{{sfnp|McKay|Bates|2010}} For example, Longfellow's poem depicts Acadia as a utopia and the Acadians as a homogeneous and passive people who are incapable of violence, which ignores the efforts of resistance leader [[Joseph Broussard]] and the [[Military history of the Acadians|extensive military history of the Acadians]].<ref>John Grenier. ''The Far Reaches of Empire: War in Nova Scotia, 1710\u20131760''. Oklahoma University Press, 2008: 6</ref> The poem also allowed for generations of Protestant [[Anglo-Americans]] to sympathize with the plight of the Acadians while maintaining [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] viewpoints. The poem also provided a safe symbolic space for Acadians to develop arguments for more recognition and respect in the United States.{{sfnp|McKay|Bates|2010|page=128}}\n\n=== Landmarks and statues ===\nIn 1920, at [[Grand-Pr\u00e9, Nova Scotia]], Acadians reconstructed the French church with a statue of Evangeline in the courtyard. Almost a decade later, in 1929, a statue of Evangeline, posed for by silent Mexican film star [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], who starred in the 1929 film ''[[Evangeline (1929 film)|Evangeline]]'', was donated to the town of [[St. Martinville, Louisiana]], by the film's cast and crew.

The Evangeline Trail ends in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]] on the southwest coast.\n\n=== Film ===\nThere have also been numerous film adaptations of the poem ''Evangeline''. [[Evangeline (1913 film)|''Evangeline'']] was the first Canadian feature film, produced in 1913 by Canadian Bioscope of Halifax. It was shot in the Annapolis Valley and at Grand-Pr\u00e9.  In 1919, [[Raoul Walsh]] made [[Evangeline (1919 film)|a film based on the poem]] for [[20th Century Fox]]. It was suggested by and starred his wife [[Miriam Cooper]]. The film was one of the duo's biggest hits but is now [[lost film|lost]]. In 1929, [[Edwin Carewe]] made [[Evangeline (1929 film)|a film version]] starring [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], shot in Louisiana and accompanied by a theme song written by [[Al Jolson]] and [[Billy Rose]].\n\nThe poem was mentioned in the 1987 film ''[[Angel Heart]]'', starring [[Mickey Rourke]] and [[Robert De Niro]]. ''Evangeline'' is also referenced in the 2009 Disney film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'', wherein a Cajun firefly named Raymond falls in love with Evangeline, who appears as a star. Following his death, they are reunited and appear side by side in the night sky.\n\n=== Music and musical theatre ===\n''Evangeline'' has been the subject of numerous songs:\n* A popular song in French titled \"Evangeline\" was written in 1971 by [[Michel Conte]].
