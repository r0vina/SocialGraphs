The bobbins, turned from wood, bone, or plastic, hold threads which are woven together and held in place with pins stuck in the pattern on the pillow. The pillow contains straw, preferably [[oat]] [[straw]] or other materials such as sawdust, insulation styrofoam, or ethafoam. Also known as bone-lace. [[Chantilly lace]] is a type of bobbin lace.\n* '''[[Chemical lace]]''': the stitching area is stitched with embroidery threads that form a continuous motif.

When they first started to use lace and through the 16th century, they primarily used cutwork. Much of their lace was made of gold, silver, and silk. Wealthy people began to use such expensive lace in clothing trimmings and furnishings, such as cushion covers. In the 1300s and 1400s in the Italian states, heavy duties were imposed on lace, and strict [[sumptuary law]]s were passed.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Jackson|first=Mrs. F.
