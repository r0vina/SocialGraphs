The duo were signed by [[MCA Records]] and their single \"Heartache the Size of Texas\" peaked at No.&nbsp;54 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1986.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Their music was produced by [[Jimmy Bowen]]. After the duo broke up, Vega worked various odd jobs in Nashville.<ref>{{cite journal|date=December 6, 1996|title=New Artist Fact File|journal=[[Radio & Records]]|page=46|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-12-06.pdf}}</ref>\n\nVega was signed to [[BNA Records]] as a solo artist in 1996. His debut single, \"Remember When,\" peaked at No.&nbsp;56 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart. The song was produced by [[Josh Leo]].<ref>{{cite magazine|date=December 28, 1996|title=Talent to spare|magazine=Billboard|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sQkEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22ray+vega%22+%22remember+when%22&pg=PA27}}</ref> After the disappointing response to the single, release of Vega's debut album, also titled ''Remember When,'' was cancelled; promotional copies, however, did enter into the marketplace. Another single, \"Even More,\" failed to chart in the United States, although it reached No.&nbsp;57 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Adult Contemporary chart in Canada.\n\nVega later recorded a pop album, 1999's ''Geography,'' that was released in Germany via [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]]. Additionally, country artist [[Dusty Drake]] recorded a composition of Vega's, entitled \"And Then,\" and released it as his debut single in 2002.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''Remember When''\n| \n* Release date: October 8, 1996\n* Label: [[BNA Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Geography''\n| \n* Release date: May 31, 1999\n* Label: [[Ariola Records]]\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN AC]]\n|-\n| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Remember When\"\n| 56\n| 94\n| \u2014\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Remember When''\n|-\n|rowspan=2|1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Can Dream\"<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 28, 1997|title=Going for Adds|journal=Radio & Records|page=56|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-03-28.pdf}}</ref>\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Even More\"<ref>{{cite journal|date=November 14, 1997|title=A/C picks|journal=Gavin Report|page=19|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Gavin-Report/90/97/Gavin-1997-11-14.pdf}}</ref>\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| 57\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
