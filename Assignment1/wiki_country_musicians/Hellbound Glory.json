But the album also finds a more folk-oriented approach to songwriting as well. \u201c13 Corners\u201d about the winding mountain roads of the interior West weaves a cautionary tale more indicative of writing from the 50s and 60s, while \u201cEvacuation Song\u201d about the [[Paradise, California#2018 fire|fire that destroyed the town of Paradise]] and killed 85 people in 2018 is something Woody Guthrie might have written if he was still around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/album-review-hellbound-glorys-nobody-knows-you/|title=Album Review \u2013 Hellbound Glory's \"Nobody Knows You\" - Saving Country Music|date=September 30, 2022|website=www.savingcountrymusic.com}}</ref>\n\n'''Track list:'''\n# \"Reeling Down\"\n# \"13 Corners\"\n# \"Can't Wait to Never See You Again\"\n# \"Word Gets Around\"\n# \"Nobody Knows You\"\n# \"Evacuation Song\"\n# \"My Woman's Whiskey Kiss\"\n# \"Wednesday's Women\"\n# \"Didn't Die Young (Ain't Done Trying)\"\n# \"Trouble in Mind\"\n\n===''Pure Scum'' (2020)===\nProduced by Shooter Jennings and recorded in L.A.'s Echo Park neighborhood, it features eight new songs from Leroy with a couple rearrangements of traditionals.\n\n'''Track list:'''\n# \"Ragged but Alright\"\n# \"Wild Orchid\"\n# \"Someone to Use\"\n# \"Loose Slots\"\n# \"Dial 911\"\n# \"Neon Leon\"\n# \"Renowhere\"\n# \"Damned Angel\"\n# \"Hank Williams Lifestyle\"\n# \"DUIORDIE\"\n\n===''Pinball'' (2017)===\nHellbound Glory's first release for [[Shooter Jennings]]'s Black Country Rock label, and their first album in six years.
