It extends northward from the Mexican boundary far into Canada. Although the [[altitude]] of the plains increases gradually from {{cvt|600|ft}} or {{cvt|1200|ft}} on the east to {{cvt|4,000|\u2013|5,000|ft}} or {{cvt|6000|ft}} near the mountains, the local relief is generally small. The [[semi-arid climate]] excludes tree growth and opens far-reaching views.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=United States, The/Physical Geography |display=United States, The \u00a7 ''Physical Geography'' |volume=27 |pages=619\u2013620 |inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe plains are by no means a simple unit. They are of diverse structure and of various stages of [[erosion]]al development. They are occasionally interrupted by [[butte]]s and [[escarpment]]s. They are frequently broken by valleys. Yet on the whole, a broadly extended surface of moderate relief so often prevails that the name, Great Plains, for the region as a whole is well-deserved.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe western boundary of the plains is usually well-defined by the abrupt ascent of the mountains. The eastern boundary of the plains (in the United States) is more [[climate|climatic]] than [[topography|topographic]]. The line of {{cvt|20|in}}<!--rain is not measured in cm--> of annual [[rainfall]] trends a little east of northward near the 97th meridian. If a boundary must be drawn where nature presents only a gradual transition, this rainfall line may be taken to divide the drier plains from the moister prairies.<ref name=EB1911/> However, in Canada the eastern boundary of the plains is well defined by the presence of the [[Canadian Shield]] to the northeast.\n\nThe plains (within the United States) may be described in northern, intermediate, central and southern sections, in relation to certain peculiar features.<ref name=EB1911/> In Canada, no such division is used: the climatic and vegetation regions are more impactful on human settlement than mere topography, and therefore the region is split into (from north to south), the [[taiga plains]], [[boreal forest|boreal plains]], [[aspen parkland]], and [[prairies|prairie ecoregion]] regions.\n\n=== Northern Great Plains === <!--- [[Northern Plains]] redirects here --->\n[[File:Plains Bison Buffalo (14958327875).jpg|thumb|Herd of Plains Bison of various ages resting in Elk Island Park, Alberta]]\n[[File:MinnesotaPrairie.jpg|thumb|The Great Plains as seen in Minnesota's upland prairie at Glacial Lakes State Park]]\n\nThe northern section of the Great Plains, north of [[44th parallel north|latitude 44\u00b0]], includes eastern [[Montana]], eastern [[Wyoming]], most of [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]], southwestern [[Minnesota]] and portions of the Canadian provinces including southeastern [[Alberta]], southern [[Saskatchewan]] and southwestern [[Manitoba]]. The strata here are [[Cretaceous]] or early [[Tertiary]], lying nearly horizontal. The surface is shown to be a plain of degradation by a gradual ascent here and there to the crest of a ragged escarpment, the escarpment-remnant of a resistant stratum. There are also the occasional [[lava]]-capped [[mesa]]s and [[dike (geology)|dike]] formed ridges, surmounting the general level by {{cvt|500|ft}} or more and manifestly demonstrating the widespread [[erosion]] of the surrounding plains. All these reliefs are more plentiful towards the mountains in central Montana. The peneplain is no longer in the cycle of erosion that witnessed its production. It appears to have suffered a regional uplift or increase in elevation, for the upper [[Missouri River]] and its branches no longer flow on the surface of the plain, but in well graded, maturely opened valleys, several hundred feet below the general level. A significant exception to the rule of mature valleys occurs, however, in the case of the Missouri, the largest river, which is broken by several falls on hard sandstones about {{cvt|50|mi}} east of the mountains. This peculiar feature is explained as the result of displacement of the river from a better graded preglacial valley by the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice sheet]]. Here, the ice sheet overspread the plains from the moderately elevated Canadian highlands far on the north-east, instead of from the much higher mountains nearby on the west. The present altitude of the plains near the mountain base is {{cvt|4000|ft}}.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe northern plains are interrupted by several small mountain areas. The Black Hills, chiefly in western South Dakota, are the largest group. They rise like a large island from the sea, occupying an oval area of about {{cvt|100|mi}} north-south by {{cvt|50|mi}} east-west. At [[Black Elk Peak]], they reach an altitude of {{cvt|7216|ft}} and have an effective relief over the plains of {{cvt|2000|or|3000|ft|}} This mountain mass is of flat-arched, dome-like structure, now well dissected by radiating consequent streams. The weaker uppermost strata have been eroded down to the level of the plains where their upturned edges are evenly truncated. The next following harder strata have been sufficiently eroded to disclose the core of underlying [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] crystalline rocks in about half of the domed area.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Intermediate Great Plains ===\nIn the intermediate section of the plains, between [[44th parallel north|latitudes 44\u00b0]] and [[42nd parallel north|42\u00b0]], including southern South Dakota and northern [[Nebraska]], the erosion of certain large districts is peculiarly elaborate. Known as the [[Badlands]], it is a minutely dissected form with a relief of a few hundred feet. This is due to several causes:\n*the dry climate, which prevents the growth of a grassy turf\n*the fine texture of the Tertiary strata in the badland districts\n*every little rill, at times of rain, carves its own little valley.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Central Great Plains ===\n[[File:Western Kansas-High Plains Nicodemus.JPG|thumb|The High Plains of Kansas, in the [[Smoky Hills]] near [[Nicodemus, Kansas|Nicodemus]]]]\nThe central section of the Great Plains, between [[42nd parallel north|latitudes 42\u00b0]] and [[36th parallel north|36\u00b0]], occupying eastern [[Colorado]] and western [[Kansas]], is mostly a dissected [[fluvial|fluviatile]] plain. That is, this section was once smoothly covered with a gently sloping plain of gravel and sand that had been spread far forward on a broad denuded area as a [[wikt:piedmont|piedmont]] deposit by the rivers which issued from the mountains. Since then, it has been more or less dissected by the erosion of valleys. The central section of the plains thus presents a marked contrast to the northern section.\n\nWhile the northern section owes its smoothness to the removal of local gravels and sands from a formerly uneven surface by the action of degrading rivers and their inflowing tributaries, the southern section owes its smoothness to the deposition of imported gravels and sands upon a previously uneven surface by the action of aggrading rivers and their outgoing distributaries. The two sections are also alike in that residual eminences still here and there surmount the peneplain of the northern section, while the fluviatile plain of the central section completely buried the pre-existent relief. An exception to this statement must be made for the southwest, close to the mountains in southern Colorado, where some lava-capped mesas ([[Mesa de Maya]], [[Raton Mesa]]) stand several thousand feet above the general plain level, and thus testify to the widespread erosion of this region before it was aggraded.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n=== Southern Great Plains ===\n[[File:Flickr - Nicholas T - Skewed.jpg|thumb|Short-grass prairie near the front range of the Rockies in Colorado]]\n[[File:Mt-scott.png|thumb|View of [[Lake Lawtonka]] and wind turbines from [[Mount Scott (Oklahoma)|Mount Scott]], Oklahoma]]\nThe southern section of the Great Plains, between latitudes 35.5\u00b0 and 25.5\u00b0, lies in western [[Texas]], eastern [[New Mexico]], and western [[Oklahoma]]. Like the central section, it is for the most part a dissected fluviatile plain. However, the lower lands which surround it on all sides place it in such strong relief that it stands up as a table-land, known from the time of Mexican occupation as the [[Llano Estacado]]. It measures roughly {{cvt|150|mi}} east-west and {{cvt|400|mi}} north-south. It is of very irregular outline, narrowing to the south. Its altitude is {{cvt|5500|ft}} at the highest western point, nearest the mountains whence its gravels were supplied. From there, it slopes southeastward at a decreasing rate, first about {{cvt|12|ft}}, then about {{cvt|7|ft/mi}}, to its eastern and southern borders, where it is {{cvt|2000|ft}} in altitude. Like the High Plains farther north, it is extraordinarily smooth.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIt is very dry, except for occasional shallow and temporary water sheets after rains. Llano is separated from the plains on the north by the mature consequent valley of the [[Canadian River]], and from the mountains on the west by the broad and probably mature valley of the [[Pecos River]]. On the east, it is strongly undercut by the retrogressive erosion of the headwaters of the Red, Brazos, and Colorado rivers of Texas and presents a ragged escarpment approximately {{cvt|500|to|800|ft}} high, overlooking the central denuded area of that state. There, between the Brazos and Colorado rivers, occurs a series of isolated outliers capped by limestone that underlies both the [[Llano Uplift]] on the west and the [[Grand Prairies]] escarpment on the east. The southern and narrow part of the table-land, called the [[Edwards Plateau]], is more dissected than the rest, and falls off to the south in a frayed-out fault scarp. This scarp overlooks the coastal plain of the [[Rio Grande]] [[embayment]]. The central denuded area, east of the Llano, resembles the east-central section of the plains in exposing older rocks. Between these two similar areas, in the space limited by the Canadian and Red Rivers, rise the subdued forms of the [[Wichita Mountains]] in [[Oklahoma]], the westernmost member of the Ouachita system.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n===Other terminology===\n<!---per DAB page--->\nThe term \"Western Plains\" is used to describe the [[ecoregion]] of the Great Plains,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lockwood |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Schell |first2=Scott P. |title=Outbreak Dynamics of Rangeland Grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) in the Western Plains Ecoregion: Eruptive, Gradient, Both, or Neither? |journal=[[Journal of Orthoptera Research]] |publisher=Orthopterists' Society |issue=4 |year=1995 |issn=1082-6467 |jstor=3503456 |pages=35\u201348 |doi=10.2307/3503456 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3503456 |access-date=October 3, 2021 |archive-date=October 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211003081847/https://www.jstor.org/stable/3503456 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<ref name=wildflowers>{{cite book |title=Wildflowers of the Western Plains: A Field Guide |isbn=978-0803219052 |quote=Stretching from western Texas and eastern New Mexico up through Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas, and into Canada, the vast western plains often appear sparse... |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=Zoe Merriman |date=September 2008 |publisher=U of Nebraska Press}}</ref> or alternatively the western portion of the Great Plains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Entwisle |first1=Barbara |last2=Stern |first2=Paul C |last3=Environment |first3=the |title=Population and Environment in the U.S. Great Plains |website=NCBI Bookshelf |date=February 3, 2003 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22969/ |access-date=October 3, 2021 |archive-date=September 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210927174909/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22969/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Natural history==\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Colorado Mountain Tornado.jpg|thumb|A tornado touching down in [[Park County, Colorado]], July 23, 2018]]\nIn general, the Great Plains have a wide range of weather, with very cold and harsh winters and very hot and humid summers. Wind speeds are often very high, especially in winter.\n\nThe 100th meridian roughly corresponds with the line that divides the Great Plains into an area that receives {{cvt|20|in}} or more of rainfall per year and an area that receives less than {{cvt|20|in}}. In this context, the High Plains, as well as [[Southern Alberta]], south-western Saskatchewan and [[Eastern Montana]] are mainly [[Semi-arid climate|semi arid]] steppe land and are generally characterised by [[ranch|rangeland]] or marginal [[Agriculture|farmland]]. The region (especially the High Plains) is periodically subjected to extended periods of [[drought]]; high winds in the region may then generate devastating [[dust storm]]s. The eastern Great Plains near the eastern boundary falls in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone in the southern areas, and the northern and central areas fall in the [[humid continental climate]].\n\nMany [[thunderstorm]]s occur in the plains in the spring through summer.

Fur trappers made their way across much of the region, making regular contacts with Indians.\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) had first been granted in 1670 a commercial monopoly over the huge [[Hudson Bay]] drainage area known as [[Rupert's Land]] covering a northern portion of the Great Plains. The [[North West Company]] fur trade incumbent had also been present in the area until acquired by the HBC during the early 1820s.\n\nThe United States acquired the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and conducted the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1804\u20131806, and more information became available concerning the Plains, and various pioneers entered the areas. Fur trading posts were often the basis of later settlements. Through the 19th century, more settlers migrated to the Great Plains as part of a vast [[United States territorial acquisitions|westward expansion]] of population, and new settlements became dotted across the Great Plains.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}\n\nThe settlers also brought diseases against which the Indians had no resistance.

Beginning in the 1830s, the [[Oregon Trail]] led from the Missouri River across the Great Plains.\n\nMuch of the Great Plains became open range where cattle roamed free, hosting ranching operations where anyone was free to run cattle. In the spring and fall, ranchers held roundups where their cowboys branded new calves, treated animals, and sorted the cattle for sale. Such ranching began in Texas and gradually moved northward. Between 1866 and 1895, cowboys herded 10&nbsp;million cattle north to rail heads such as [[Dodge City, Kansas]]<ref>Robert R.

Hundreds of thousands of people claimed such homesteads, sometimes building houses out of the very turf of the land. Many of them were not skilled farmers, and failures were frequent.

The railroads offered attractive packages of land and transportation to American farmers, who rushed to settle the land. They also took advantage of the homestead laws to obtain farms. Land speculators and local boosters identified many potential towns, and those reached by the railroad had a chance, while the others became ghost towns. Towns flourished if they were favored by proximity to the railroad.<ref>Gilbert Fite. \u2018\u2019The Farmers\u2019 Frontier, 1865-1900\u2019\u2019 (1966) pp 34-136.</ref>\n\nThe population of Minnesota, Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas experienced significant growth during the 1870s.  The total population in these states grew from 1.0 million in 1870 to 2.4 million in 1880, more than doubling in just 10 years.  The number of farms in the region tripled, increasing from 99,000 in 1870 to 302,000 in 1880.  The improved acreage (land under cultivation) quintupled, rising from 5.0 million acres to 24.6 million acres during the same period. the new settlers mostly purchased land on generous terms from transcontinental railroads that were given land grants by Washington. They focused on wheat and cattle. This rapid population influx and agricultural expansion was a hallmark of the settlement and development of the Great Plains in the late 19th century, as the region attracted waves of new settlers from Germany, Scandinavia, and Russia, as well as farmers who sold land in older states to move to larger farms.<ref>Gilbert C.

Homestead land was free for American settlers. Railroads sold their land at cheap rates to immigrants in the expectation that they would generate traffic as soon as farms were established. Immigrants poured in, especially from Germany and Scandinavia. On the plains, very few single men attempted to operate a farm or ranch by themselves; they understood the need for a hard-working wife and numerous children to handle the many responsibilities.<ref>Deborah Fink, ''Agrarian Women: Wives and Mothers in Rural Nebraska, 1880\u20131940'' (1992).</ref> During the early years of settlement, farm women played an integral role in assuring family survival by working outdoors. After approximately one generation, women increasingly left the fields, thus redefining their roles within the family. New technology encouraged women to turn to domestic roles, including sewing and washing machines. Media and government extension agents promoted the \"scientific housekeeping\" movement, along with county fairs which featured achievements in home cookery and canning, advice columns for women regarding farm book keeping, and home economics courses in the schools.<ref>Chad Montrie, \"'Men Alone Cannot Settle a Country:' Domesticating Nature in the Kansas-Nebraska Grasslands\", ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Fall 2005, Vol. 25 Issue 4, pp. 245\u2013258.

This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable,<ref>Amanda Rees, ''The Great Plains region'' (2004) p. xvi</ref> and there has been a proposal to return approximately {{cvt|139000|sqmi}} of these drier parts to native prairie land as a [[Buffalo Commons]].\n\n==Wind power==\nThe Great Plains contributes substantially to [[wind power in the United States]].

The band comprised Jack Sundrud (currently, as of 2015, of [[Poco (band)|Poco]]), Russ Pahl, Denny Dadmun-Bixby, Michael Young, and Lex Browning. In their career, they recorded two studio albums and had four singles enter the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Their highest charting single, \"Faster Gun\", peaked at No.&nbsp;41.\n\n==Early days==\nThe band began with Jack Sundrud, Russ Pahl, and Michael Young, who were all working in [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]]'s (\"Bluer Than Blue\") backup band.  Sundrud was a seasoned professional, having toured with various acts such as [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Nicolette Larson]], and [[Allman Brothers]] guitarist [[Dickey Betts]]. [[Brent Maher]] was producing Johnson and was looking for a new band to produce. Maher liked the sound of Michael Johnson's backup band. Sundrud was playing bass at the time, so Maher asked Austin Cunningham to join the band in the studio to do some experimentation.  The band recorded a few tracks, mostly Cunningham's songs with himself on lead vocals.  The band lineup / instrumentation at that time was Austin Cunningham on acoustic guitar and lead vocals; Jack Sundrud on bass and vocals; Russ Pahl on lead guitar, steel guitar and vocals, and Michael Young on drums.  After recording a few sessions, Cunningham decided that he wanted to pursue a solo career and left the band. Sundrud then played some of his own songs for producer Maher and his daughter, Dianna, who ran Maher's publishing company, Moraine Music. They liked the songs and signed Sundrud to their publishing company as a [[songwriter]]. Maher and the band then recorded more tracks of Sundrud\u2019s material, with Sundrud on lead vocals.\n\nThe band showcased for RCA, and they passed. It was around this time that the band decided to hire a regular bassist and move Sundrud to acoustic guitar and lead vocals, so in 1989, the band added Denny Dadmun-Bixby to join the band on bass and vocals.  Sundrud first met Bixby when the latter was recording with [[Wild Choir]], [[Gail Davies]]\u2019 band (Sundrud's first road gig was with Davies in 1982.) The recording of the first record was slow and piece-meal since the band all had other gigs and needed income \u2014 Pahl was working with [[Don Williams]], Bixby with Wild Choir and Gail Davies, and Young was doing sessions and had a growing custom-car business building cars. The band recorded when they could until 1989, but in early 1990, Sundrud was asked to join [[country rock]] band Poco after [[Richie Furay]] had left the Legacy tour (the Legacy tour and album initially featured all 5 original Poco members.) This was Sundrud's second stint with Poco, having been a member of the band from 1985\u201387; Sundrud's first professional band, the Minnesota-based Podipto, a regional band signed to GRT Records, had opened for Poco in 1971.  Sundrud's Poco gig put off the finishing of the Great Plains project for a year.\n\n==Record deal==\nThe band finished the recording in 1991, showcased for Sony/Columbia and got a record deal.  The d\u00e9but album was produced by Brent Maher and [[Don Potter (musician)|Don Potter]], assisted by Brian Maher.  The first single, \"A Picture of You\", written by Sundrud and songwriter [[Gary Burr]] peaked at No.&nbsp;48. \"Faster Gun\" was their highest chart entry at No.&nbsp;41.\n\nThe first album failed to bring in large sales numbers and both Russ Pahl and Michael Young left the band in 1992.  Sundrud and Bixby hung on, using studio musicians to record most of a second album, but during the recording process, their record label, Sony, had a changing of executives and the band was dropped in 1993.\n\nAlso in 1993, they were nominated by the [[Academy of Country Music]] for Top New Vocal Group or Duet, along with [[Confederate Railroad]] and [[Little Texas (band)|Little Texas]], but lost to Confederate Railroad.\n\nIt was around this time that Brent Maher became involved with what would become Magnatone Records, an independent label financed by Roy Speer, who founded the [[Home Shopping Network]]. Other artists included [[Shelby Lynne]], [[Billy Montana]], [[Rich McCready]], and [[Caryl Mack Parker]].\n\n==Another chance==\nSundrud and Bixby decided to make Great Plains a band again and brought multi-instrumentalist / singer Lex Browning on board. They scrapped what they had been working on during the second album and started over, with Brent Maher and Don Potter producing again. The result was 1996's ''\"Homeland\"''.  The label released 3 singles from that album, all of which once again failed to move beyond the 40s in the charts, including \"Dancin' With The Wind\", written by Sundrud and long-time Nashville songwriter / performer Craig Bickhardt; \"Healin' Hands\", written by Sundrud and Chuck Cannon; and \"Wolverton Mountain\", written by [[Claude King]] and [[Merle Kilgore]]. \"Dancin' With The Wind\" and \"Wolverton Mountain\" also had videos produced. The band then recorded a couple of songs with Sundrud's friend, producer Michael Clute ([[Diamond Rio]]). Magnatone released a single, \"There's More Where That Came From\", written by Sundrud and Tia Sillers, but they dropped the band the day after the single was released. Great Plains played some prior-committed dates for a few months and disbanded for good in 1996.\n\n==After disbanding==\nJack Sundrud rejoined Poco in 2000 and is still with the band as of 2015, once again playing bass and providing vocals.  Sundrud co-wrote the hit \"[[Cain's Blood]]\" with Michael Johnson for the vocal group [[4 Runner]], which peaked at No.&nbsp;26 on the country charts in 1995. He also co-wrote (with Craig Bickhardt) the No.&nbsp;1 country hit \"[[It Must Be Love (Ty Herndon song)|It Must Be Love]]\" for [[Ty Herndon]]. Sundrud recorded a solo album, ''By My Own Hand'', in 2005, and a second album effort in collaboration with Craig Bickhardt called ''Idlewheel'' in 2006 which morphed into a full band with tour dates through 2008.\n\nLex Browning returned to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he had previously played with [[Jeffrey Frederick]]'s band, [[Les Clams]]. He is a member of the [[Freak Mountain Ramblers]], with whom he has recorded four albums, and in 2009 released his first solo album, Good Rain on [[Red Newt Records]].  As of September 2018, Browning joined his ex-bandmate Sundrud in Poco, where he plays guitar, fiddle and vocals.\n\nDadmun-Bixby sang backing vocals on [[Suzy Bogguss]]' 1998 album ''[[Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt]]''.  He toured with Suzy Bogguss and Rodney Crowell playing Bass and adding backing vocals before returning to Portland, Oregon where he often performs with Lex Browning.   He has also released two CDs of his own, ''Fish Out Of Water'' in 2002 and ''JOYRIDE'' in 2017.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Great Plains''\n| \n* Release date: October 22, 1991\n* Label: [[Columbia Records]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Homeland''\n| \n* Release date: June 4, 1996\n* Label: Magnatone Records\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1991\n! scope=\"row\"| \"A Picture of You\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-08-24.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=August 24, 1991}}</ref>\n| 63\n| \u2014\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Great Plains''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Faster Gun\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Billboard/90s/1991/BB-1991-12-14.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 14, 1991}}</ref>\n| 41\n| 42\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Iola\"\n| 63\n| 71\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Dancin' with the Wind\"\n| 58\n| \u2014\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Homeland''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Healin' Hands\"\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"[[Wolverton Mountain]]\"\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| 1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"There's More Where That Came From\"\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| align=\"left\"| Single only\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n!
