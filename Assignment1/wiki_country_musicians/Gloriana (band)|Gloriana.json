Retrieved 23 December 2012</ref>\nThe first performance was presented at the [[Royal Opera House]], London, in 1953 during the celebrations of the [[coronation]] of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. ''Gloriana'' was the name given by the 16th-century poet [[Edmund Spenser]] to his character representing Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in his poem ''[[The Faerie Queene]]''. It became the popular name given to Elizabeth I.\n\nThe opera depicts the relationship between Queen Elizabeth and the [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], and was composed for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953. Several in the audience of its gala opening were disappointed by the opera, which presents the first Elizabeth as a sympathetic, but flawed, character motivated largely by vanity and desire. The premiere was one of Britten's few critical failures, and the opera was not included in the series of complete Decca recordings conducted by the composer. However, a symphonic suite extracted from the opera by the composer (Opus 53a), which includes the Courtly Dances, is often performed as a concert piece.\n\n==Performance history==\nThe opera premiered on 8 June 1953 at the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden, six days after the [[coronation of Elizabeth II]].

Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, provokes Mountjoy into fighting with him and is slightly wounded. Queen Elizabeth arrives and scolds the men for their jealousy. She requests that they attend her at court as friends. Mountjoy and Essex make peace and the crowd praise Elizabeth.\n\n''Scene 2: The Queen's apartment, [[Nonsuch Palace]]''\n\nElizabeth and Cecil discuss the rivalry between Mountjoy and Essex. Cecil warns Elizabeth about the threat of another Armada from Spain and cautions her that it would be dangerous to show too much affection to the impulsive Essex. After Cecil has gone, Essex himself enters and sings to the Queen to take her mind off political problems. He asks her to let him go to Ireland to counter the rebellion led by the [[Hugh O'Neill, 3rd Earl of Tyrone|Earl of Tyrone]]. He grows impatient when the Queen shows reluctance, and accuses Cecil and Walter Raleigh of plotting against him. Elizabeth sends him away and prays for strength to rule her people well.\n\n===Act 2===\n\n''Scene 1: Norwich''\n\nThe Queen, accompanied by Essex, visits Norwich, and talks with the Recorder of Norwich. A [[masque]] celebrating Time and Concord is given in her honour.\n\n''Scene 2: Essex's house''\n\nEssex's sister Lady Penelope Rich meets Mountjoy for an illicit tryst in the garden. Essex and his wife Frances join them, and Essex denounces the Queen for thwarting his plans to go to Ireland. He, Mountjoy and Lady Rich imagine gaining power as the Queen gets older, but Frances urges caution.\n\n''Scene 3: The [[Palace of Whitehall]]''\n\nA ball is in progress at the Palace. Frances, Lady Essex, is wearing a beautifully ornate dress, which is much admired by members of the court. The Queen commands the musicians to play an energetic melody; the courtiers dance a set of five energetic \"Courtly Dances\". The ladies retire to change their linen. Lady Essex enters, wearing a plainer dress than before and tells Lady Rich that her original dress has gone missing. The Queen arrives wearing Lady Essex's dress, which is far too short and tight for her. She mocks Lady Essex and withdraws again. Mountjoy, Essex and Lady Rich comfort the humiliated Lady Essex. Essex expresses his fury at the Queen's behaviour, but calms down when Elizabeth returns, in her own clothes. She appoints Essex Lord Deputy of Ireland. Everyone celebrates.\n\n===Act 3===\n\n''Scene 1: Nonsuch Palace''\n\nThe Queen's maids gossip about Essex's failure to control the Irish rebellion. Essex bursts in and insists on seeing the Queen immediately, even though she is wigless and in her dressing gown. Elizabeth sadly admits to Essex that she is an old woman. She receives him kindly and is initially sympathetic to his troubles, but grows impatient as he complains about his enemies at court. When he has left, her maids dress her and make up her face. Cecil arrives and warns her that the Irish rebels and the hot-headed Essex both pose a threat to her reign. Elizabeth agrees that Essex should be kept under house arrest.\n\n''Scene 2: A street in the City of London''\n\nA ballad singer recounts Essex's attempts to incite rebellion, while Essex's followers try to gather new recruits. A herald announces that Essex is branded a traitor, and that anyone who supports him will be guilty of treason.\n\n''Scene 3: The Palace of Whitehall''\n\nEssex has been sent to the [[Tower of London]]. Cecil, Raleigh and other councillors try to persuade the Queen to sentence Essex to death, but she is reluctant. Alone, she muses on her continued fondness for Essex. Lady Essex, Lady Rich and Lord Mountjoy arrive to beg for mercy for Essex. The Queen treats the gentle Lady Essex kindly and reassures her that she and her children will not suffer. However, she becomes angry when the proud Lady Rich implies that the Queen needs Essex to rule effectively. Elizabeth refuses to listen to further entreaties and signs Essex's death warrant. Alone again, she reflects on her relationship with Essex and her own mortality.\n\n==Recordings==\n* [[1984 in music|1984]] [[Sarah Walker (mezzo-soprano)|Sarah Walker]] (Queen Elizabeth I), [[Anthony Rolfe Johnson]] (Earl of Essex), [[Jean Rigby]] (Countess of Essex), [[Neil Howlett]] (Lord Mountjoy), [[Alan Opie]] (Sir Robert Cecil), [[Elizabeth Vaughan]] (Lady Rich), [[Richard Van Allan]] (Sir Walter Raleigh), Malcolm Donnelly (Henry Cuffe); [[English National Opera]] Chorus and Orchestra; [[Mark Elder]] (conductor).

Prior to the group's foundation, Kimball recorded as a solo artist. The original lineup recorded one [[Gloriana (album)|self-titled album]] for Emblem/[[Reprise Records]] in 2009, which included their first chart hit, \"[[Wild at Heart (Gloriana song)|Wild at Heart]]\". Kimball left before the release of the band's second album ''[[A Thousand Miles Left Behind]]'', which produced their highest-charting single, \"[[(Kissed You) Good Night]]\", along with the top 20 \"[[Can't Shake You]]\". After a third album, ''[[Three (Gloriana album)|Three]]'', Reinert left as well, effectively disbanding the group.\n\n==History==\nBrothers Tom and Mike Gossin were born in [[Utica, New York]].<ref name=\"cmt\"/> They both took [[classical piano]] lessons from age 5.  At 10, Tom began studying jazz with a local [[jazz music|jazz]] musician and at 12, he began to play the guitar. Tom, along with third Gossin brother Stephen, founded their own band \"Oblique\" in high school. Stephen and Tom later moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] together, where they attended [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington]], with Tom majoring in guitar. After a professor suggested that he pursue songwriting and performing, Tom dropped out of the university and started playing music and selling independent records at gigs he played.  Mike learned drums at age 8 and, like Tom, started playing guitar at 12.  He moved to Wilmington after high school to join Tom there.  He joined a group with Tom and Stephen during which time they filmed a reality series that did not last long.
