When he was in his teens, his sister began to introduce him to country artists by playing him tapes on the way to the beach in exchange for Kelley washing her car. By the time Kelley was ready to graduate from [[Seabreeze High School]] in 2004 and Daytona State College in 2007, he was splitting his time between baseball (playing college baseball at [[Daytona State College]] and Florida State University and being scouted by the pros) and writing music. However, when he was doing more bench sitting than playing, he filled the void with writing. He later decided to move to [[Belmont University]].<ref name=\"Brian Kelley\">{{cite web |url=http://bigloudshirt.com/writers-and-artists/brian-kelley-big-loud-mountain-writer |title=Brian Kelley |publisher=Big Loud Shirt |access-date=2015-07-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410105550/http://bigloudshirt.com/writers-and-artists/brian-kelley-big-loud-mountain-writer |archive-date=2015-04-10 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Florida Georgia Line (2010\u20132022)===\nKelley was introduced to [[Tyler Hubbard]] at Belmont University in 2007 while they were in a campus worship group together.
