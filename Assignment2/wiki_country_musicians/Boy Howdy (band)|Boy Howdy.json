Its members were [[Jeffrey Steele]] (lead vocals, bass guitar), Hugh Wright (drums), and brothers Cary Park (guitar, [[mandolin]], vocals) and Larry Park (guitar, fiddle, vocals). Between 1992 and 1995, the band recorded two albums (1992's ''[[Welcome to Howdywood]]'' and 1995's ''[[Born That Way]]'') and an [[extended play]] (1994's ''[[She'd Give Anything]]''), all on the [[Curb Records]] label. In that same time span, Boy Howdy charted seven [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including the Top Five hits \"[[She'd Give Anything (song)|She'd Give Anything]]\" and \"[[They Don't Make 'Em Like That Anymore]].\" After Boy Howdy disbanded in 1996, Steele worked as both a solo artist and songwriter.\n\n== History ==\nBoy Howdy was founded in [[Los Angeles, California]], [[United States]] in 1990.
