Her parents were listed in the [[1860 United States census]] as living about {{convert|7|mi|km}} northeast of Princeton in [[Ravanna, Missouri|Ravanna]]. Her father Robert Wilson Canary had a gambling problem, and little is known about her mother Charlotte M. Canary. Jane was the eldest of six children, with two brothers and three sisters.\n\nIn 1865, the family moved by wagon train from Missouri to [[Virginia City, Montana]]. In 1866, Charlotte died of [[pneumonia]] along the way, in [[Blackfoot, Montana]]. After arriving in Virginia City in the spring of 1866, Robert took his six children to [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. They arrived in the summer, and Robert supposedly started farming on {{convert|40|acre|ha}} of land. The family had been in Salt Lake City for only a year when he died in 1867. At age 14, Martha Jane took charge of her five younger siblings, loaded their wagon, and took the family to [[Fort Bridger]], [[Wyoming Territory]], where they arrived in May 1868. From there, they traveled on the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to [[Piedmont, Wyoming]].\n\nIn Piedmont, Jane took whatever jobs she could find to provide for her large family.

We were ordered out to quell an uprising of the Indians, and were out for several days, had numerous skirmishes during which six of the soldiers were killed and several severely wounded. When on returning to the Post we were ambushed about a mile and a half from our destination. When fired upon, Capt. Egan was shot. I was riding in advance and on hearing the firing turned in my saddle and saw the Captain reeling in his saddle as though about to fall. I turned my horse and galloped back with all haste to his side and got there in time to catch him as he was falling. I lifted him onto my horse in front of me and succeeded in getting him safely to the Fort. Capt.

According to the Montana ''Anaconda Standard'' of April 19, 1904, he stated that Calamity Jane \"never saw service in any capacity under either General Crook or [[Nelson A. Miles|General Miles]]. She never saw a lynching and never was in an Indian fight. She was simply a notorious character, dissolute and devilish, but possessed a generous streak which made her popular.\"\n\nA popular belief is that she instead acquired the nickname as a result of her warnings to men that to offend her was to \"court calamity\". It is possible that \"Jane\" was not part of her name until the nickname was coined for her.{{sfn|Walker|2004|pp=200\u2013201}} It is certain, however, that she was known by that nickname by 1876, because the arrival of the Hickok [[wagon train]] was reported in Deadwood's newspaper, the ''Black Hills Pioneer'', on July 15, 1876, with the headline: \"Calamity Jane has arrived!\"{{sfn|McLaird|2005|p=58}}\n\nAnother account in her autobiographical pamphlet is that her detachment was ordered to the [[Big Horn River]] under General Crook in 1875. She swam the [[Platte River]] and travelled {{convert|90|mi|km}} at top speed while wet and cold in order to deliver important dispatches. She became ill afterwards and spent a few weeks recuperating. She then rode to [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming and joined a wagon train headed north in July 1876. The second part of her story is verified. She was at Fort Laramie in July 1876, and she did join a wagon train that included Wild Bill Hickok. That was where she first met Hickok, contrary to her later claims, and that was how she happened to come to Deadwood.{{sfn|Jucovy|2012|p=23}}\n\n== Deadwood and Wild Bill Hickok ==\nCalamity Jane accompanied the [[Newton\u2013Jenney Party]] into [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] in 1875, along with [[California Joe Milner|California Joe]] and [[Valentine McGillycuddy]]. In 1876, Calamity Jane settled in the area of [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], in the [[Black Hills]].

She presented evidence that Calamity Jane and Wild Bill had married at Benson's Landing, [[Montana Territory]] (now [[Livingston, Montana]]) on September 25, 1873. The documentation was written in a Bible and presumably signed by two ministers and numerous witnesses.

Routledge.</ref>\n\nCalamity Jane does seem to have had two or four daughters, although the father's identity is unknown. In the late 1880s, Jane returned to Deadwood with a child who she said was her daughter. At Jane's request, a benefit was held in one of the theaters to raise money for her daughter's education in St. Martin's Academy at [[Sturgis, South Dakota]], a nearby Catholic boarding school. The benefit raised a large sum; Jane got drunk and spent a considerable portion of the money that same night and left with the child the next day.\n\nEstelline Bennett was living in Deadwood at that time and had spoken briefly with Jane a few days before the benefit. She thought that Jane honestly wanted her daughter to have an education and that the drunken binge was just an example of her inability to curb her impulses and carry through long-range plans (which Bennett saw as typical of Jane's class). Bennett later heard that Jane's daughter did \"get an education, and grew up and married well\".<ref>Estelline Bennet, Old Deadwood Days, pp. 229\u2013232, 240\u2013242. Quote from p. 242.

Following McCall's execution for the crime, Jane continued living in the Deadwood area for some time, and at one point, she helped save numerous passengers in an overland [[stagecoach]] by diverting several [[Plains Indians]] who were in pursuit of the vehicle.

She also participated in the 1901 [[Pan-American Exposition]].\n\nHer addiction to liquor was evident even in her younger years. For example, on June 10, 1876, she rented a horse and buggy in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] for a one-mile joy ride to Fort Russell and back, but she was so drunk that she passed right by her destination without noticing it and finally ended up about {{convert|90|mi|km}} away at Fort Laramie.{{sfn|Griske|2005|pp=87\u201388}}\n\n==Death==\nJane returned to the Black Hills in the spring (April/May) of 1903, where brothel owner Madame Dora DuFran was still running her business.

This series, written by [[Edward Wheeler (novelist)|Edward Wheeler]], established her with a reputation as a Wild West heroine and probably did more to enhance her familiarity to the public than any of her real life exploits. There is no evidence that she was consulted by Wheeler or approved the Deadwood Dick stories, so the character in the stories was entirely fictitious\u2014as were the events described\u2014but the fictional adventures were muddled in the public mind with the real Jane.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Calamity Jane was the title character in a serial published in ''[[Street & Smith|New York's Street & Smith's Weekly]]'' (1882) under the title, ''Calamity Jane: Queen of the Plains'', by the author \"Reckless Ralph\".\n\nThe science fiction writer [[A.
