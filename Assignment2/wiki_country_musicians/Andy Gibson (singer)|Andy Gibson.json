He led a [[big band]] while serving in the [[United States Army]] from 1942-45.\n\nAfter his discharge, he continued working with Barnet but focused primarily on [[R&B]] music. He was musical director for [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] from 1955\u201360 and recorded four songs as a leader in 1959 which were released by [[RCA Camden]].
