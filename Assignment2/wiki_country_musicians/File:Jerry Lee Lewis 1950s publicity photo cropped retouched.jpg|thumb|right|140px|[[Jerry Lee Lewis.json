Elsewhere, it is considered a 'digit' due to the few features it has in difference with the other four digits, such as the larger gap, missing phalanx and horizontal curling movement.|group=upper-alpha}} When a person is standing in the medical [[anatomical position]] (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit. The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is [[wikt:pollex|''pollex'']] (compare [[Toe#Hallux|''hallux'']] for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is [[wikt:pollical|''pollical'']].\n\n==Definition==\n{{nosources|section|date=April 2024}}\n===Thumb and fingers===\nThe English word ''finger'' has two [[Finger numbering|senses]], even in the context of appendages of a single typical human hand:\n1) Any of the five terminal members of the hand.\n2) Any of the four terminal members of the hand, other than the thumb\n\nLinguistically, it appears that the original sense was the first of these two: {{Lang|mis|*penkwe-ros}}<!-- Proto-Indo-European --> (also rendered as {{Lang|mis|*penqr\u00f3s}}<!-- Proto-Indo-European -->) was, in the inferred [[Proto-Indo-European language]], a suffixed form of {{Lang|mis|*penkwe}}<!-- Proto-Indo-European --> (or {{Lang|mis|*penqe}}<!-- Proto-Indo-European -->), which has given rise to many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]-family words (tens of them defined in English dictionaries) that involve, or stem from, concepts of fiveness.\n\nThe thumb shares the following with each of the other four fingers:\n* Having a skeleton of [[phalanges]], joined by hinge-like joints that provide flexion toward the palm of the hand\n* Having a dorsal surface that features hair and a nail, and a hairless palmar aspect with [[fingerprint]] ridges\n\nThe thumb contrasts with each of the other four fingers by being the only one that:\n* Is opposable to the other four fingers\n* Has two [[phalanges]] rather than three. However, recently there have been reports that the thumb, like other fingers, has three phalanges, but lacks a metacarpal bone.<ref>Haeri, Seyed Mohammad Jafar, et al. \"Human thumb consists of three phalanges and lacks metacarpal?

Napier proposed two primary [[prehensile]] grips: the ''precision grip'' and the ''power grip''.<ref>{{harvnb|Napier|1956|pp=902\u2013913}}</ref> The precision and power grip are defined by the position of the thumb and fingers where:\n* The '''power grip''' is when the fingers (and sometimes palm) clamp down on an object with the thumb making counter pressure. Examples of the power grip are gripping a hammer, opening a jar using ''both your palm and fingers'', and during pullups.\n* The '''precision grip''' is when the intermediate and distal phalanges (\"fingertips\") and the thumb press against each other. Examples of a precision grip are writing with a pencil, opening a jar ''with the fingertips alone'', and gripping a ball (only if the ball is not tight against the palm).\n\n[[File:Distal-phalanges-thumb-index Journal.pone.0011727.g001.png|thumb|right|Thumb and index finger during pad-to-pad precision grasping<ref name=\"PLOS-2010\">{{harvnb|Alm\u00e9cija|Moy\u00e0-Sol\u00e0|Alba|2010}}</ref>]]\nOpposability of the thumb should not be confused with a precision grip as some animals possess semi-opposable thumbs yet are known to have extensive precision grips ([[Cebus apella|Tufted Capuchins]] for example).<ref>{{harvnb|Costello|Fragaszy|1988|pp=235\u2013245}}</ref> Nevertheless, precision grips are usually only found in higher apes, and only in degrees significantly more restricted than in humans.<ref>{{harvnb|Young|2003|pp=165\u2013174}}, {{harvnb|Christel|Kitzel|Niemitz|2004|pp=165\u2013194}}, {{harvnb|Byrne|Byrne|1993|p=241}}</ref>\n\nThe pad-to-pad pinch between the thumb and index finger is made possible because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the [[Distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the index finger.

The distal pad of the human thumb is divided into a proximal and a distal compartment, the former more deformable than the latter, which allows the thumb pad to mold around an object.<ref name=\"Jones-Lederman-2006-p12\" />\n\nIn robotics, almost all [[robotic hand]]s have a long and strong opposable thumb.

As a result, these primates are unable to perform the pad-to-pad grip associated with opposability. However, in [[pronograde]] monkeys such as [[baboon]]s, an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle has led to reduced finger length and thus hand proportions similar to those of humans. Consequently, these primates have dexterous hands and are able to grasp objects using a pad-to-pad grip. It can thus be difficult to identify hand adaptations to manipulation-related tasks based solely on thumb proportions.<ref name=\"Moy\u00e0-Sol\u00e0-1999\">{{harvnb|Moy\u00e0-Sol\u00e0|K\u00f6hler|Rook|1999 |loc= pp. 315\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe evolution of the fully opposable thumb is usually associated with ''[[Homo habilis]]'', a forerunner of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Leakey|Tobias|Napier|1964|}}: \"[In Homo habilis] the pollex is well developed and fully opposable and the hand is capable not only of a power grip but of, at least, a simple and usually well developed precision grip.\"</ref> This, however, is the suggested result of evolution from ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (around 1 [[mya (unit)|mya]]) via a series of intermediate [[simian|anthropoid]] stages, and is therefore a much more complicated link.\n\nModern humans are unique in the musculature of their forearm and hand.

And, it is logical that a conservative, highly functional adaptation be followed by a series of more complex ones that complement it.
