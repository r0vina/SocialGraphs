Many of the songs he has written have become Top-10 hits, the first of which was \"[[Love's Been A Little Bit Hard On Me]]\" released by [[Juice Newton]] (#7 on Billboard's Hot 100) in 1982. He became a member of the group [[Pure Prairie League]] (1984 to 1985), taking over after [[Vince Gill]] departed the group. Burr later moved to Nashville to focus on his songwriting career, though he has continued performing and is currently a member of the [[Blue Sky Riders]]. He has written and co-written songs for many [[Country music|country]] artists ([[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Patty Loveless]], etc.), and a few songs for Pop and Rock artists ([[Juice Newton]], [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], and [[Lisa Loeb]]).\n\n==Songs written/co-written by Gary Burr==\n{{inc-musong|date=October 2021}}\n* \"Rainy Day Man\" \u2013 [[Joey Molland]]\n* \u201cI Was Here\u201d -
