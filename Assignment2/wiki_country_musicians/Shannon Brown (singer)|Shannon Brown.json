Although she has recorded three albums on various labels, only one of these \u2013 2006's ''[[Corn Fed (album)|Corn Fed]]'' \u2014 was released. In her career, she has charted four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, with her highest-charting single being a 2002 cover of [[Deborah Allen]]'s \"Baby I Lied,\" at number 40. She also contributed the song \"Half a Man\" to the soundtrack for the 1998 film ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\nAfter several years of touring the Midwest with her father running the soundboard and her mom running lights, Shannon decided to make the move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. She paid the bills singing songwriters' demo sessions and managed to maintain her touring schedule of 160 dates a year. Her vocal stylings and industrious approach did not go unnoticed. She is married to video director [[Shaun Silva]] who directed the video for \"Corn Fed.\"\n\n==Career==\nBrown's first recording contract was with [[Arista Nashville]] in 1997. A year later, she began work on her debut album ''A Tour of My Heart''. Although the album's lead-off single (titled \"I Won't Lie\") entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, ''A Tour of My Heart'' was ultimately unreleased. Brown also contributed the song \"Half a Man\" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]'' in 1998\n\nIn late 2001, she left for the [[BNA Records|BNA]] label. While on BNA, she began work on a second album, from which two singles were released. The first of these, a song titled \"Baby I Lied,\" was a cover of [[Deborah Allen]]'s Top 5 hit single from 1983. Brown's cover became her only Top 40 hit upon its release. A second single from her BNA album, titled \"Untangle My Heart,\" also charted. Brown's second album also remained unreleased, however, and she exited BNA not long afterward.\n\n[[Warner Bros. Records]] signed Brown to her third recording contract in late 2005. That year, she made her fourth chart entry with the song \"Corn Fed.\" Reaching a peak of 47 on the country music charts, it served as the lead-off single to her first album for Warner Bros., also titled ''[[Corn Fed (album)|Corn Fed]]''. Her third album overall, ''Corn Fed'' was also Brown's first album to be released commercially. The album was produced by [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]], one half of country music duo [[Big & Rich]]. After its second single, \"Pearls,\" failed to chart, Brown and Warner Bros. parted ways.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Corn Fed (album)|Corn Fed]]''\n| \n* Release date: February 28, 2006\n* Label: [[Warner Bros.
