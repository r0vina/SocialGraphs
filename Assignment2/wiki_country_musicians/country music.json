[[Gid Tanner|James Gideon \"Gid\" Tanner]] (1885\u20131960) was an American old-time fiddler and one of the earliest stars of what would come to be known as country music. His band, the [[Skillet Lickers]], was one of the most [[Innovation|innovative]] and influential string bands of the 1920s and 1930s. Its most notable members were [[Clayton McMichen]] (fiddle and vocal), [[Dan Hornsby]] (vocals), [[Riley Puckett]] (guitar and vocal) and Robert Lee Sweat (guitar). New York City record label [[Okeh Records]] began issuing hillbilly music records by [[Fiddlin' John Carson]] as early as 1923, followed by [[Columbia Records]] (series 15000D \"Old Familiar Tunes\") ([[Samantha Bumgarner]]) in 1924, and [[RCA Victor Records]] in 1927 with the first famous pioneers of the genre [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], who is widely considered the \"Father of Country Music\", and the first family of country music the [[Carter Family]].<ref name=\"78discography.com\">[http://www.78discography.com/COL15000D.htm 78discography.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917050611/http://78discography.com/COL15000D.htm |date=September 17, 2010 }} ''The Online Discography Project''.</ref> Many \"hillbilly\" musicians recorded blues songs throughout the 1920s.<ref name=\"Russell 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225\">{{cite book| last = Russell| first = Tony| title = Country Music Originals: The Legends and the Lost| date = November 15, 2007| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-532509-6| pages = [https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14 14, 15, 25, 31, 45, 59, 73, 107, 157, 161, 165, 167, 225]| url = https://archive.org/details/countrymusicorig00russ/page/14}}</ref>\n\nDuring the second generation (1930s\u20131940s), radio became a popular source of entertainment, and \"barn dance\" shows featuring country music were started all over the South, as far north as Chicago, and as far west as California. The most important was the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', aired starting in 1925 by [[WSM (AM)|WSM]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and continuing to the present day. During the 1930s and 1940s, cowboy songs, or western music, which had been recorded since the 1920s, were popularized by films made in Hollywood, many featuring [[Gene Autry]], who was known as king of the \"singing cowboys,\" and [[Hank Williams]]. [[Bob Wills]] was another country musician from the Lower [[Great Plains]] who had become very popular as the leader of a \"[[Dixieland|hot]] [[string band]],\" and who also appeared in [[Western (genre)|Hollywood westerns]]. His mix of country and [[jazz]], which started out as dance hall music, would become known as [[western swing]]. Wills was one of the first country musicians known to have added an electric guitar to his band, in 1938.<ref name=\"Takecountryback.com\">[http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm Takecountryback.com], Merle Haggard \u2013 Bob Wills {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513085028/http://takecountryback.com/reviews/merlebobwills.htm |date=May 13, 2008 }}</ref> Country musicians began recording [[boogie-woogie|boogie]] in 1939, shortly after it had been played at [[Carnegie Hall]], when [[Johnny Barfield]] recorded \"Boogie Woogie\".\n\nThe third generation (1950s\u20131960s) started at the end of [[World War II]] with \"mountaineer\" string band music known as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], which emerged when [[Bill Monroe]], along with [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] were introduced by [[Roy Acuff]] at the Grand Ole Opry. [[Gospel music]] remained a popular component of country music. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], Hispano, and [[American frontier]] music of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], became popular among poor communities in [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[Texas]]; the basic ensemble consisted of [[classical guitar]], [[bass guitar]], [[dobro]] or steel guitar, though some larger ensembles featured [[electric guitar]]s, [[trumpet]]s, [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s (especially the honky-tonk piano, a type of [[tack piano]]), [[banjo]]s, and [[drum]]s. By the early 1950s it blended with [[rock and roll]], becoming the [[rockabilly]] sound produced by [[Sam Phillips]], [[Norman Petty]], and [[Bob Keane]]. Musicians like [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Buddy Holly]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Ritchie Valens]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Johnny Cash]] emerged as enduring representatives of the style. Beginning in the mid-1950s, and reaching its peak during the early 1960s, the [[Nashville sound]] turned country music into a multimillion-dollar industry centered in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]; [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]] were two of the most broadly popular Nashville sound artists, and their deaths in separate plane crashes in the early 1960s were a factor in the genre's decline. Starting in the 1950s to the mid-1960s, western singer-songwriters such as [[Michael Martin Murphey]] and [[Marty Robbins]] rose in prominence as did others, throughout western music traditions, like [[New Mexico music]]'s [[Al Hurricane]]. The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of [[enthusiasm]] in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]].\n\nFourth generation (1970s\u20131980s) music included [[outlaw country]] with roots in the [[Bakersfield sound]], and [[country pop]] with roots in the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]], folk music and [[soft rock]]. Between 1972 and 1975 singer/guitarist [[John Denver]] released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles. By the mid-1970s, [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] gained popularity with performers like [[Freddie Fender]]. During the early 1980s country artists continued to see their records perform well on the pop charts. In 1980 a style of \"neocountry disco music\" was popularized. During the mid-1980s a group of new artists began to emerge who rejected the more polished country-pop sound that had been prominent on radio and the charts in favor of more traditional \"back-to-basics\" production.\n\nDuring the fifth generation (the 1990s), [[Neotraditional country|neotraditionalists]] and [[stadium rock|stadium country]] acts prospered.\n\nThe sixth generation (2000s\u2013present) has seen a certain amount of diversification in regard to country music styles. It has also, however, seen a shift into patriotism and conservative politics since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], though such themes are less prevalent in more modern trends.<ref name=\"Hudak, Yahoo\">{{cite web |last1=Hudak |first1=Joseph |title=Country Music Embraced Jingoism after 9/11.

Western music, influenced by the cowboy ballads, [[New Mexico music|New Mexico]], [[Texas country music|Texas country]] and [[Tejano music]] rhythms of the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Northern Mexico]], reached its peak in popularity in the late 1950s, most notably with the song \"[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]\", first recorded by [[Marty Robbins]] in September 1959. Western music's influence would continue to grow within the country music sphere, western musicians like [[Michael Martin Murphey]], [[New Mexico music]] artists [[Al Hurricane]] and [[Antonia Apodaca]], [[Tejano music]] performer [[Little Joe (singer)|Little Joe]], and even folk revivalist [[John Denver]], all first rose to prominence during this time. This western music influence largely kept the music of the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] and [[folk rock]] from influencing the country music genre much, despite the similarity in instrumentation and origins (see, for instance, [[the Byrds]]' negative reception during their appearance on the ''Grand Ole Opry''). The main concern was largely political: most folk revival was largely driven by progressive activists, a stark contrast to the culturally conservative audiences of country music. John Denver was perhaps the only musician to have major success in both the country and folk revival genres throughout his career, later only a handful of artists like [[Burl Ives]] and Canadian musician [[Gordon Lightfoot]] successfully made the crossover to country after folk revival fell out of fashion.

Under the direction of producers such as [[Chet Atkins]], [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], [[Owen Bradley]], [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]], and later [[Billy Sherrill]], the sound brought country music to a diverse audience and helped revive country as it emerged from a commercially fallow period. This subgenre was notable for borrowing from 1950s pop stylings: a prominent and smooth vocal, backed by a [[string section]] (violins and other orchestral strings) and vocal chorus. Instrumental soloing was de-emphasized in favor of trademark \"licks\". Leading artists in this genre included [[Jim Reeves]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[Connie Smith]], [[the Browns]],{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 10\u201311}} [[Patsy Cline]], and [[Eddy Arnold]]. The \"slip note\" piano style of session musician [[Floyd Cramer]] was an important component of this style.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/floyd-cramer |title=Rockhall.com |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> The Nashville Sound collapsed in mainstream popularity in 1964, a victim of both the [[British Invasion]] and the deaths of Reeves and Cline in separate airplane crashes. By the mid-1960s, the genre had developed into [[countrypolitan]]. Countrypolitan was aimed straight at mainstream markets, and it sold well throughout the later 1960s into the early 1970s. Top artists included [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Lynn Anderson]] and [[Charlie Rich]], as well as such former \"hard country\" artists as [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] and [[Marty Robbins]].

Although the term first referred to country music songs and artists that crossed over to top 40 radio, country pop acts are now more likely to cross over to [[adult contemporary music]]. It started with pop music singers like [[Glen Campbell]], [[Bobbie Gentry]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Anne Murray]], [[B. J. Thomas]], [[the Bellamy Brothers]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] having hits on the country charts. Between 1972 and 1975, singer/guitarist John Denver released a series of hugely successful songs blending country and folk-rock musical styles (\"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\", \"[[Sunshine on My Shoulders]]\", \"[[Annie's Song]]\", \"[[Thank God I'm a Country Boy]]\", and \"[[I'm Sorry (John Denver song)|I'm Sorry]]\"), and was named Country Music Entertainer of the Year in 1975. The year before, Olivia Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, won the \"Best Female Country Vocal Performance\" as well as the Country Music Association's most coveted award for females, \"Female Vocalist of the Year\". In response George Jones, Tammy Wynette, [[Jean Shepard]] and other traditional Nashville country artists dissatisfied with the new trend formed the short-lived \"Association of Country Entertainers\" in 1974; the ACE soon unraveled in the wake of Jones and Wynette's bitter divorce and Shepard's realization that most others in the industry lacked her passion for the movement.\n[[File:Dolly Parton, 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Dolly Parton]]]]\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a successful mainstream country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to cross over to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"[[Here You Come Again]]\", which topped the U.S. country singles chart, and also reached No. 3 on the pop singles charts. Parton's male counterpart, [[Kenny Rogers]], came from the opposite direction, aiming his music at the country charts, after a successful career in pop, rock and folk music with [[Kenny Rogers and the First Edition|the First Edition]], achieving success the same year with \"[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]]\", which topped the country charts and reached No. 5 on the U.S. pop singles charts, as well as reaching Number 1 on the British all-genre chart.

Country music propelled Kenny Rogers\u2019 career, making him a three-time [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] winner and six-time [[Country Music Association Awards]] winner.

The late 1960s in American music produced a unique blend as a result of traditionalist backlash within separate genres. In the aftermath of the [[British Invasion]], many desired a return to the \"old values\" of rock n' roll. At the same time there was a lack of enthusiasm in the country sector for Nashville-produced music. What resulted was a crossbred genre known as [[country rock]]. Early innovators in this new style of music in the 1960s and 1970s included [[Bob Dylan]], who was the first to revert to country music with his 1967 album ''[[John Wesley Harding]]''{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=show 54}} (and even more so with that album's follow-up, ''[[Nashville Skyline]]''), followed by [[Gene Clark]], Clark's former band [[the Byrds]] (with [[Gram Parsons]] on ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'') and its spin-off [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] (also featuring Gram Parsons), guitarist [[Clarence White]], [[Michael Nesmith]] ([[the Monkees]] and the [[First National Band]]), the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Neil Young]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]], [[the Allman Brothers Band]], [[Charlie Daniels]], [[the Marshall Tucker Band]], [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Buffalo Springfield]], [[Stephen Stills]]' band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], among many, even the former folk music duo [[Ian & Sylvia]], who formed [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]] in 1969.

Many of the artists during the latter half of the 1980s drew on traditional honky-tonk, bluegrass, folk and western swing. Artists who typified this sound included [[Travis Tritt]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[George Strait]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Randy Travis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Clint Black]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], and [[the Judds]].\n\n===Fifth generation (1990s)===\n\n[[File:Garth Brooks at We Are One (edit).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Garth Brooks]]]]\n{{See also|1990s_in_music#Country_music|l1=1990s in music \u00a7 Country}}\nCountry music was aided by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) Docket 80\u201390, which led to a significant expansion of [[FM radio]] in the 1980s by adding numerous higher-fidelity FM signals to rural and suburban areas. At this point, country music was mainly heard on rural [[AM radio]] stations; the expansion of FM was particularly helpful to country music, which migrated to FM from the AM band as AM became overcome by [[talk radio]] (the country music stations that stayed on AM developed the [[classic country]] format for the AM audience). At the same time, [[beautiful music]] stations already in rural areas began abandoning the format (leading to its effective demise) to adopt country music as well. This wider availability of country music led to producers seeking to polish their product for a wider audience. In 1990, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which had published a [[Hot Country Songs|country music chart]] since the 1940s, changed the methodology it used to compile the chart: singles sales were removed from the methodology, and only airplay on [[country radio]] determined a song's place on the chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=R&B Enjoying Rare Dominance Over Rap|magazine=Billboard|date=April 24, 2004|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mxAEAAAAMBAJ&q=Nielsen+Broadcast+Data+Systems+january+20+1990&pg=PA68|access-date=April 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, country music became a worldwide phenomenon thanks to [[Garth Brooks]],<ref name=\"Country Worldwide\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0LYxAAAAIBAJ&pg=1510,3298161&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country is No. 1 musical style |date=August 19, 1992 |newspaper=Reading Eagle |access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide2\">{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TjQfAAAAIBAJ&pg=4760,3698051&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+country+worldwide&hl=en |title=Country music reflects the time |date=September 27, 1992 |publisher=Herald-Journal |access-date=July 26, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Country Worldwide3\">{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google |title=Country music is making waves across the seas |date=November 25, 1993 |work=thestar.com |access-date=July 26, 2010 |first=Jack |last=Hurst |archive-date=May 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506081606/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/504338431.html?dids=504338431:504338431&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+25%2C+1993&author=Jack+Hurst&pub=The+Record&desc=Country+music+is+making+waves+across+the+seas&pqatl=google |url-status=dead }}</ref> who enjoyed one of the most successful careers in popular music history, breaking records for both sales and concert attendance throughout the decade.

[[Toby Keith]] began his career as a more pop-oriented country singer in the 1990s, evolving into an outlaw persona in the early 2000s with ''[[Pull My Chain]]'' and its follow-up, ''[[Unleashed (Toby Keith album)|Unleashed]]''.\n\n====Success of female artists====\n[[File:LindaRonstadtPerforming.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Linda Ronstadt]]]]\nFemale artists such as [[Reba McEntire]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Martina McBride]], [[Deana Carter]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], [[Mindy McCready]], [[Pam Tillis]], [[Lorrie Morgan]], [[Shania Twain]], and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] all released platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. The [[Dixie Chicks]] became one of the most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' went on to become certified 12\u00d7 platinum while their 1999 album ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' went on to become 10\u00d7 platinum. After their third album, ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'', was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer [[Natalie Maines]]'s comments disparaging then-President [[George W. Bush]] while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the [[Iraq War]] a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall among non-country audiences but largely ignored among country audiences. After ''Taking the Long Way'', the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the [[Court Yard Hounds]]) before reuniting in 2016 and releasing new material in 2020.\n\n[[File:ShaniaTwain3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shania Twain]] performing during her [[Up! Tour]] in 2004]]\nCanadian artist [[Shania Twain]] became the best selling female country artist of the decade. This was primarily due to the success of her breakthrough sophomore 1995 album, ''[[The Woman in Me (album)|The Woman in Me]]'', which was certified 12\u00d7 platinum sold over 20&nbsp;million copies worldwide and its follow-up, 1997's ''[[Come On Over]]'', which was certified 20\u00d7 platinum and sold over 40&nbsp;million copies. The album became a major worldwide phenomenon and became one of the world's best selling albums for three years (1998, 1999 and 2000); it also went on to become the best selling country album of all time.\n\nUnlike the majority of her contemporaries, Twain enjoyed large international success that had been seen by very few country artists, before or after her. Critics have noted that Twain enjoyed much of her success due to breaking free of traditional country stereotypes and for incorporating elements of rock and pop into her music. In 2002, she released her successful fourth studio album, titled ''[[Up! (album)|Up!]]'', which was certified 11\u00d7 platinum and sold over 15&nbsp;million copies worldwide. [[Shania Twain]] has been nominated eighteen times for [[Grammy Awards]] and won five Grammys.

She is also credited with changing the way in which many female country performers would market themselves, as unlike many before her she used fashion and her sex appeal to get rid of the stereotypical '[[honky-tonk]]' image the majority of country singers had in order to distinguish herself from many female country artists of the time.\n\n====Line dancing revival====\nIn the early-mid-1990s, country western music was influenced by the popularity of [[line dancing]]. This influence was so great that [[Chet Atkins]] was quoted as saying, \"The music has gotten pretty bad, I think. It's all that damn line dancing.\"<ref>The Roots of Country Music\" Collectors Edition by ''Life'', September 1, 1994</ref> By the end of the decade, however, at least one line dance choreographer complained that good country line dance music was no longer being released. In contrast, artists such as [[Don Williams]] and [[George Jones]] who had more or less had consistent chart success through the 1970s and 1980s suddenly had their fortunes fall rapidly around 1991 when the new chart rules took effect.\n\n====Alternative country====\n{{Main|Alt country|cowpunk}}\n\n[[File:Steve_Earle_2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|[[Steve Earle]] performing in Ireland in 2007]]\nCountry influences combined with [[Punk rock]] and [[alternative rock]] to forge the \"[[cowpunk]]\" scene in Southern California during the 1980s, which included bands such as [[the Long Ryders]], [[Lone Justice]] and [[the Beat Farmers]], as well as the established punk group [[X (American band)|X]], whose music had begun to include country and rockabilly influences.<ref name=\"Malone2002\">W.

Underwood's debut album, ''[[Some Hearts (Carrie Underwood album)|Some Hearts]]'', became the best-selling solo female debut album in country music history, the fastest-selling debut country album in the history of the SoundScan era and the best-selling country album of the last 10 years, being ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the number 1 Country Album of the 2000\u20132009 decade. She has also become the female country artist with the most number one hits on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991\u2013present), having 14 #1s and breaking her own ''[[Guinness Book]]'' record of ten. In 2007, Underwood won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]], becoming only the second Country artist in history (and the first in a decade) to win it. She also made history by becoming the seventh woman to win Entertainer of the Year at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], and the first woman in history to win the award twice, as well as twice consecutively. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' has listed Underwood as one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]].\nIn 2016, Underwood topped the [[Country Airplay]] chart for the 15th time, becoming the female artist with the most number ones on that chart.\n[[File:Miranda-Lambert-Bandwagon-Tour-2019.jpg|thumb|218x218px|[[Miranda Lambert]] in 2019]]\nCarrie Underwood was only one of several country stars produced by a television series in the 2000s.

The series ''[[Nashville Star]]'', while not nearly as successful as ''Idol'', did manage to bring [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]] to mainstream success, also launching the careers of lower-profile musicians such as [[Buddy Jewell]], [[Sean Patrick McGraw]], and Canadian musician [[George Canyon]]. ''[[Can You Duet]]?'' produced the duos [[Steel Magnolia]] and [[Joey + Rory]]. Teen sitcoms also have influenced modern country music; in 2008, actress [[Jennette McCurdy]] (best known as the sidekick Sam on the teen sitcom ''[[iCarly]]'') released her first single, \"So Close\", following that with the single \"[[Generation Love]]\" in 2011. Another teen sitcom star, [[Miley Cyrus]] (of Disney Channel's ''[[Hannah Montana]]''), also had a crossover hit in the late 2000s with \"[[The Climb (Miley Cyrus song)|The Climb]]\" and another with a duet with her father, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], with \"[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]].\" [[Jana Kramer]], an actress in the teen drama ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', released a country album in 2012 that has produced two hit singles as of 2013.

In addition to Lady A, groups such as [[Little Big Town]], [[the Band Perry]], [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]], [[Thompson Square]], [[Eli Young Band]], [[Zac Brown Band]] and British duo [[The Shires (duo)|the Shires]] have emerged to occupy a large share of mainstream success alongside solo singers such as [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Miranda Lambert]].\n\n[[File:191125 Taylor Swift at the 2019 American Music Awards.png|alt=|left|thumb|189x189px|[[Taylor Swift]] at the [[American Music Awards of 2019|2019 American Music Awards]]]]\nOne of the most commercially successful country artists of the late 2000s and early 2010s has been singer-songwriter [[Taylor Swift]]. Swift first became widely known in 2006 when her debut single, \"[[Tim McGraw (song)|Tim McGraw]]\", was released when Swift was only 16 years old. In 2006, Swift released her [[Taylor Swift (album)|self-titled debut studio album]], which spent 275 weeks on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], one of the longest runs of any album on that chart. In 2008, Taylor Swift released her second studio album, ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'', which made her the second longest number-one charted on ''Billboard'' 200 and the second best-selling album (just behind [[Adele]]'s ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'') within the past 5 years. At the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards|2010 Grammys]], Taylor Swift was 20 and won Album of the Year for ''Fearless'', which made her the youngest artist to win this award. Swift has received fourteen [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] already.\n\nBuoyed by her [[teen idol]] status among girls and a change in the methodology of compiling the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts to favor pop-crossover songs, Swift's 2012 single \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\" spent the most weeks at the top of Billboard's [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and [[Hot Country Songs]] chart of any song in nearly five decades. The song's long run at the top of the chart was somewhat controversial, as the song is largely a pop song without much country influence and its success on the charts was driven by a change to the chart's criteria to include airplay on non-country radio stations, prompting disputes over what constitutes a country song; many of Swift's later releases, such as album ''[[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|1989]]'' (2014), ''[[Reputation (Taylor Swift album)|Reputation]]'' (2017), and ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) were released solely to [[Pop music|pop]] audiences.<ref>{{cite magazine

Influenced by US country music, it has developed a distinct style, shaped by British and Irish folk ballads and Australian [[bush ballad]]eers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Country instruments, including the guitar, [[banjo]], [[fiddle]] and harmonica, create the distinctive sound of country music in Australia and accompany songs with strong storyline and memorable chorus.\n\nFolk songs sung in Australia between the 1780s and 1920s, based around such themes as the struggle against government [[tyranny]], or the lives of [[bushranger]]s, [[swagmen]], [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]], [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[sheep shearer|shearers]], continue to influence the genre. This strain of Australian country, with lyrics focusing on Australian subjects, is generally known as \"bush music\" or \"[[bush band]] music\". \"[[Waltzing Matilda]]\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial [[national anthem]], is a quintessential Australian country song, influenced more by British and Irish folk ballads than by US country and western music. The lyrics were composed by the poet Banjo Paterson in 1895. Other popular songs from this tradition include \"[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]\", \"[[Click Go the Shears]]\", \"The Queensland Drover\" and \"The Dying Stockman\". Later themes which endure to the present include the experiences of war, of droughts and flooding rains, of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginality]] and of the railways and trucking routes which link Australia's vast distances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |title=Bush songs and music \u2013 Australia's Culture Portal |work=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |access-date=February 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406104520/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/bush/ |archive-date=April 6, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |title=Australian country music \u2013 Australia's Culture Portal |work=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=November 24, 2006 |access-date=February 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217020802/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/country/ |archive-date=February 17, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kasey_Chambers_at_APRA_Music_Awards_2012_(cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kasey Chambers]] arguably one of the most successful Australian female country singers.]]\n\nPioneers of a more Americanised popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] (known as \"The Father of Australian Country Music\") in the 1930s.

At the end of the war, Williams would go on to operate some of the largest travelling tent rodeo shows Australia has ever seen.\n\nIn 1952, Dawson began a radio show and went on to national stardom as a singing cowboy of radio, TV and film.

Country and western music never really developed separately in Canada; however, after its introduction to Canada, following the spread of radio, it developed quite quickly out of the Atlantic Canadian traditional scene. While true Atlantic Canadian traditional music is very Celtic or \"[[sea shanty]]\" in nature, even today, the lines have often been blurred.

It ended with \"[[Till We Meet Again (1918 song)|Till We Meet Again]]\". The guest performance slot gave national exposure to numerous Canadian folk musicians, including [[Stompin' Tom Connors]] and [[Catherine McKinnon]]. Some Maritime country performers went on to further fame beyond Canada. [[Hank Snow]], [[Wilf Carter (musician)|Wilf Carter]] (also known as Montana Slim), and [[Anne Murray]] are the three most notable.

For these reasons [[polka]]s and western music were always popular in the region, and with the introduction of the radio, mainstream country music flourished. As the culture of the region is western and frontier in nature, the specific genre of country and western is more popular today in the Prairies than in any other part of the country. No other area of the country embraces all aspects of the culture, from two-step dancing, to the cowboy dress, to rodeos, to the music itself, like the Prairies do.

It includes a number of different styles, usually named after their region of origin. One specific song style, the [[Ranchera|Canci\u00f3n Ranchera]], or simply Ranchera, literally meaning \"[[ranch]] song\", found its origins in the Mexican countryside and was first popularized with [[Mariachi]]. It has since also become popular with [[Grupera|Grupero]], [[Banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Tierra Caliente music|Tierra Caliente]], [[Duranguense]] and other regional Mexican styles. The [[Corrido]], a different song style with a similar history, is also performed in many other regional styles, and is most related to the [[Western music (North America)|western]] style of the United States and Canada. Other song styles performed in regional Mexican music include [[Sentimental ballad|Ballad]]s, [[Cumbia]]s, [[Boleros]], among others. Country en Espa\u00f1ol (Country in Spanish) is also popular in Mexico. Some Mexican artists began performing country songs in Spanish during the 1970s, and the genre became prominent mainly in the northern regions of the country during the 1980s. A Country en Espa\u00f1ol popularity boom also reached the central regions of Mexico during the 1990s. For most of its history, Country en Espa\u00f1ol mainly resembled [[Neotraditional country]].

A handful of country musicians had even greater success in mainstream British music than they did in the U.S., despite a certain amount of disdain from the music press.

Welsh singer [[Bonnie Tyler]] initially started her career making country records, and in 1978 her single \"[[It's a Heartache]]\" reached number four on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. In 2013, Tyler returned to her roots, blending the country elements of her early work with the rock of her successful material on her album ''[[Rocks and Honey]]'' which featured a duet with [[Vince Gill]].

It actually launched just two days after CMT. In 2000, after TNN and CMT fell under the same corporate ownership, TNN was stripped of its country format and rebranded as ''The National Network'', then ''Spike TV'' in 2003, ''Spike'' in 2006, and finally [[Paramount Network]] in 2018. TNN was later revived from 2012 to 2013 after [[Jim Owens Entertainment]] (the company responsible for prominent TNN hosts [[Crook & Chase]]) acquired the trademark and licensed it to [[Get After It Media|Luken Communications]]; that channel renamed itself Heartland after Luken was embroiled in an unrelated dispute that left the company bankrupt.\n\n[[Great American Family|Great American Country]] (GAC) was launched in 1995, also as a country music-oriented channel that would later add lifestyle programming pertaining to the American Heartland and South. In Spring 2021, GAC's then-owner, [[Discovery, Inc.]] divested the network to [[Great American Media|GAC Media]], which also acquired the equestrian network [[Great American Living|Ride TV]]. Later, in the summer of that year, GAC Media relaunched Great American Country as GAC Family, a family-oriented general entertainment network, while Ride TV was relaunched as GAC Living, a network devoted to programming pertaining to lifestyles of the American South. The GAC acronym which once stood for \"Great American Country\" now stands for \"Great American Channels\".\n\n===Canadian television===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nOnly one television channel was dedicated to country music in Canada: [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] owned by [[Corus Entertainment]] (90%) and Viacom (10%). However, the lifting of strict genre licensing restrictions saw the network remove the last of its music programming at the end of August 2017 for a schedule of generic off-network family sitcoms, [[Canadian content|Cancom]]-compliant lifestyle programming, and reality programming. In the past, the current-day [[Cottage Life (TV channel)|Cottage Life]] network saw some country focus as Country Canada and later, CBC Country Canada before that network drifted into an alternate network for overflow CBC content as Bold. [[Stingray Music]] continues to maintain several country music audio-only channels on [[cable radio]].\n\nIn the past, country music had an extensive presence, especially on the Canadian national broadcaster, [[CBC Television]]. The show ''[[Don Messer's Jubilee]]'' significantly affected country music in Canada; for instance, it was the program that launched [[Anne Murray]]'s career. [[Gordie Tapp]]'s ''[[Country Hoedown]]'' and its successor, ''[[The Tommy Hunter Show]]'', ran for a combined 36 years on the CBC, from 1956 to 1992; in its last nine years on air, the U.S. cable network TNN carried Hunter's show.\n\n===Australian cable television===\nThe only network dedicated to country music in Australia was the [[Country Music Channel]] owned by [[Foxtel]].
