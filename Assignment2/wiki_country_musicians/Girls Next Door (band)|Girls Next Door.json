The group consists of vocalists Doris King Merritt, Cindy Nixon Psanos, Diane Williams Austin, and Tammy Stephens Smith. The quartet recorded between 1982 and 1991, issuing two albums on [[MTM Records]] and one on [[Atlantic Records]]. They disbanded in 1991 and briefly reunited in 2011 before reuniting a second time in 2023.\n\n==History==\nGirls Next Door was founded in 1982 by record producer [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]], best known for working with [[Jim Croce]]. West was a friend of [[session musician|session vocalist]] Doris King, and suggested that she form an all-female vocal group due to the concept being uncommon in country music at the time.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The other members chosen for the group were Cindy Nixon, Diane Williams, and Tammy Stephens.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p13053/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Girls Next Door biography |accessdate=May 22, 2008 |last=Brennan |first=Sandra |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> All four of the members had met through mutual connections at [[Opryland USA]], a former theme park in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], which often employed musicians to perform there.<ref name=\"boro\"/> They originally wanted to call themselves Belle and Wildflower, but after finding that other groups existed with those names, West suggested \"Girls Next Door\" after a song he wrote.<ref name=\"damon\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/106566698/ | title=New group closes in on success | work=The Anniston Star | agency=May 14, 1986 | accessdate=September 11, 2024 | author=Damon Adams | pages=10C}}</ref>\n\nThe four began rehearsing in Williams's basement and went on to record several songs with West. Despite not having a record deal at the time, they also began performing in local bars around Nashville. In 1984, the quartet was signed to [[MTM Records]], a record label division of actress [[Mary Tyler Moore]]'s [[MTM Enterprises]].<ref name=\"damon\"/> MTM released the group's self-titled debut album ''[[The Girls Next Door (album)|The Girls Next Door]]'' in 1984, with West producing.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It charted four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.

A seventh single for MTM, \"Love and Other Fairy Tales\", was never put on an album due to MTM closing soon afterward.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nIn 1989, Girls Next Door signed with [[Atlantic Records]] for their third album ''How 'Bout Us'' under the production of Nelson Larkin.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It charted the singles \"He's Gotta Have Me\" and \"[[How 'Bout Us (song)|How 'Bout Us]]\", a cover of [[Champaign (band)|Champaign]]'s 1981 single. These singles also failed to make top 40 on the country charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Girls Next Door retired in 1991, after a performance on the talk show ''[[Nashville Now]]''.
