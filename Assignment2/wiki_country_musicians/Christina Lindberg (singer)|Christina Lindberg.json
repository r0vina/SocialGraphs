Her first appearance in an American film, ''[[Maid in Sweden]]'' (1971) was filmed with a predominantly Swedish cast in her home country. Her first role in a Swedish film was in [[Jan Halldoff]]'s comedy ''[[R\u00f6tm\u00e5nad]]'' (1970). The film was seen by over 250,000 Swedes, a record for the time, and went on to become a commercial success.<ref name=sfi>[http://www.svenskfilmdatabas.se/ Swedish Film Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125055306/http://www.svenskfilmdatabas.se/ |date=25 November 2006 }} Svenskfilmdatabas.se</ref> Her third film, ''[[Exponerad]]'' (1971), was released with a lot of hype at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] that year, and turned her into an international celebrity.<ref name=exponerad>Interviews with Lindberg and director on Swedish DVD-release of ''Exposed''</ref> As part of the marketing campaign for ''Exponerad'', Lindberg embarked on a promotional trip across Japan, which later resulted in an invitation to appear in Japanese films. There, she played a major supporting role in [[Norifumi Suzuki]]'s [[Pink film]] classic ''[[Sex & Fury]]'' (1973). \n\nA string of sexploitation films followed, many of which were filmed in Germany or Japan. In 1973, she starred as Madeleine in [[Bo A. Vibenius]]'s controversial film ''[[Thriller \u2013 A Cruel Picture|Thriller \u2013 en grym film]]'' (1973).

Damiano (who also directed the infamous ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'') persuaded Lindberg to leave because he knew that it was going to be a hardcore film. For several years, the German producer tried to bring her back, in an attempt to complete the film. According to Videooze (No. 8, 1996), about 1,000 meters of film had been shot by Damiano. Production ceased and never resumed.\n\nAfter a long absence from acting, Lindberg appeared in the 2016 thriller ''Lindangens Park'', the 2018 horror movie ''Svart Cirkel'' (directed by Adrian Garcia Bogliano) and in the 2020 sci-fi feature ''Pandemonic''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/XgeRnB/christina-lindberg-gor-comeback--efter-tarantinos-hyllning|title = Christina Lindberg g\u00f6r comeback \u2013 efter Tarantinos hyllning}}</ref>\n\n==Post film career==\nIn her introduction to Daniel Ekeroth's book ''Swedish Sensationsfilms: A Clandestine History of Sex, Thrillers, and Kicker Cinema'', Christina Lindberg explains that after leaving exploitation films behind, she has been busy with numerous other projects. In 1972 she met future fianc\u00e9 [[Bo Sehlberg]] and later started to work for his [[aviation]] magazine ''[[Flygrevyn]]''. When Sehlberg died in 2004, Lindberg took over ownership and the position as editor-in-chief of the magazine\u2014which is the largest aviation magazine in Scandinavia.
