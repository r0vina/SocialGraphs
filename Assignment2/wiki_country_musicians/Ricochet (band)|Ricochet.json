Ricochet behavior may vary with bullet shape, bullet material, spin, velocity (and distance), target material and the angle of incidence.<ref>[http://www.astm.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/JOURNALS/FORENSIC/PAGES/942.htm?E+mystore Bullet Ricochet: A Comprehensive Review ], Burke, TW, Rowe, WF, Journal of Forensic Sciences, September 1, 1992</ref>\n \n===Velocity===\nHigh-velocity rifle cartridges have higher probability of bullet penetration, because increased energy released by an identical bullet may fracture or temporarily melt the target at the point of impact. Alternatively, the same energy release may melt and/or disintegrate the bullet to reduce size and range of deflected particles. Ricochets are more likely with handgun cartridges and low velocity rifle cartridges such as [[.22 Long Rifle]]. [[Shotgun shell#Buckshot|Buckshot]] and shotgun [[Slug (projectile)|slugs]] have similarly high ricochet probability, but ricochet range of smaller [[Shot (pellet)|shot]] is lower than intact rifle or handgun bullet ricochets.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=140066 |title=Bullet Ricochet: A Comprehensive Review |last1=Burke |first1=T.W. |last2=Rowe |first2=W.F. |website=National Criminal Justice Reference Service |publisher=[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]] |access-date=2 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Bullet===\n[[Sectional density]], or mass of the bullet divided by the frontal area of the bullet, increases penetration of resistant surfaces. Elongated, spin-stabilized bullets fired from rifled firearms have greater sectional density than spherical bullets of the same diameter made from the same material; and elongated rifle cartridge bullets have greater sectional density than short bullets of the same diameter handgun cartridges. Bullet velocity is reduced by as much as 35% by each ricochet deflection, and velocity is further reduced by air resistance as cohesive bullet fragments often produce an audible whine tumbling after losing stability.<ref name=rai/>\n\n===Target material===\nComparative hardness and density determine the results of collisions with bullets. Bullets tend to penetrate low density materials like air with little deflection, although friction causes rotated projectiles to drift in the direction of rifling twist as the bullet falls through the atmosphere under the influence of gravity. Ricochets may be similarly deflected in the direction of rotation of the side of a spin-stabilized bullet contacting a resistant surface.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Haag |first1=Michael G. |last2=Haag |first2=Lucien C.  |title =Shooting Incident Reconstruction |publisher =Academic Press |date =2011 |page =150 |isbn =978-0123822413}}</ref> Dense objects tend to prevail in collisions with less dense objects; so dense bullets tend to penetrate less dense materials, and dense materials tend to deflect light bullets. Resistance to penetration can be evaluated as the sectional density of the target material along the axis of bullet movement in front of the bullet. Metallic foil will be more easily penetrated than metal ingots, and sectional density of sheet metal increases as orientation of the sheet diverges from perpendicular to, toward parallel with, the bullet path. Bullets are more likely to ricochet off flat, hard surfaces such as concrete, rock or steel, but a ricochet can occur from irregular surfaces within heterogeneous materials including soil and vegetation. Uniformly soft, flexible materials like sand have a lower incidence of ricochet.<ref name=\"box\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theboxotruth.com/docs/bot7.htm|title=The Box O' Truth #7 - The Sands O' Truth|work=The Box O' Truth|access-date=5 October 2014}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=January 2015|certain=y}} Though it may not be intuitive, bullets easily ricochet off water;<ref>Haag, L.C., \"Bullet Ricochet from Water,\" AFTE Journal, Vol. 11, No. 3, July 1979, pp. 27-34.</ref><ref>Nennstiel, R., \"Study of Bullet Ricochet on a Water Surface,\" AFTE Journal, Vol. 16, No. 3, July 1984, pp. 88-93.</ref> compare [[stone skipping]].\n\n===Angle===\nThe angle of departure, both vertically and horizontally, is difficult to calculate or predict due to the many variables involved, not the least of which is the deformation of the bullet caused by its impact with the surface it strikes.<ref>Jauhari, M., \"Approximate Relationship Between the Angles of Incident and Ricochet for Practical Application in the Field of Forensic Science,\" Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science, Vol. 62, 1970, pp. 122-125.</ref> Probability of ricochet is highest from surfaces approximately parallel to the axis of bullet movement, and grazing ricochets typically depart the surface at a smaller angle than the angle of incidence (or approach).<ref name=rai/> Probability of bullet penetration increases as the axis of bullet movement becomes perpendicular to the target surface; but penetration may create a depression or crater within which the bullet may ricochet more than once, possibly following the arc of the crater floor to depart the crater at a greater angle from the original surface than the angle of incidence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266259240 |title=Projectile Ricochet from Wooden Targets |last1=Koene |first1=L. |last2=Hermsen |first2=Rob |last3=Brouwer |first3=S.D. |access-date=2 March 2017 }}</ref> In an extreme case, a strong, cohesive bullet striking a nearly perpendicular elastic surface may ricochet directly back at the shooter.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Karger, B |author2=Joosten, U |title=A case of \u201cboomerang\u201d bullet ricochet. |journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |date=October 2001 |issue=115 |pages=70-71 |doi=10.1007/s004140000148 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs004140000148 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS4tcLg5oCg|title=.50 sniper gets hit by ricochet bullet|work=YouTube|access-date=5 October 2014}}</ref> This situation is sometimes observed when hardened [[armor-piercing bullet]] cores fail to completely penetrate steel plate.

A responsible shooter anticipates potential bullet interactions within a [[cone]] of space around the aim point. The shooter is at the apex of the cone, and the cone is symmetrical around the intended bullet path. The angle of that cone may initially be defined by the accuracy of the firearm and the skill of the shooter; but any ricochet potential within the cone becomes the apex of a ricochet cone with a broader angle. The ground surface is a frequent source of ricochets. A bullet may be deflected more than once before it comes to rest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nm/field_offices/las_cruces/las_cruces_planning/tricounty_rmp/tricounty_draft_rmp.Par.29778.File.pdf/20_APP-N_TRICOUNTY_DRMP_VOL2_Safety_Zones_for_Recreational_Target_Shooting_281KB.pdf |title=Safety Zones for Recreational Target Shooting |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |access-date=3 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304114201/https://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nm/field_offices/las_cruces/las_cruces_planning/tricounty_rmp/tricounty_draft_rmp.Par.29778.File.pdf/20_APP-N_TRICOUNTY_DRMP_VOL2_Safety_Zones_for_Recreational_Target_Shooting_281KB.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDamage potential of ricochets, like bullets, is proportional to the [[mass]] of the bullet fragment and the [[square (algebra)|square]] of its velocity. Ricochet velocity is always lower than collision velocity, but may be close to collision velocity for small angles of deflection. Ricochet mass may be similarly close to original bullet mass for [[full metal jacket bullet]]s or [[green bullet]]s replacing soft [[lead]] with solid [[copper]] or a steel core. [[Frangible bullet]]s or lead core [[varmint hunting]] bullets are more susceptible to collision damage, and produce smaller ricochet fragments. Lower initial mass gives small fragment ricochets less damage potential, and distance of travel is reduced by more rapid loss of velocity from air resistance. Reduced ricochet range is one of the reasons the newer [[.17 HMR]] round with its frangible bullet has gained popularity against the older non-fragmenting [[.22 WMR]].\n\nRicochets can be lethal.

The band was founded in 1993 by brothers Jeff Bryant ([[Drum kit|drums]], [[Singing|vocals]]) and Junior Bryant ([[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], vocals), along with Heath Wright ([[Singing#Lead and backing vocalists|lead vocals]], [[lead guitar]], fiddle), Greg Cook ([[bass guitar]], vocals), Teddy Carr ([[steel guitar]], [[Dobro]]), and Eddie Kilgallon ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[rhythm guitar]], [[saxophone]], vocals).\n\nAfter several years of playing throughout the [[Southern United States]], Ricochet was signed to a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]] in 1995. Their self-titled debut album produced three straight Top Ten hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including the Number One single \"[[Daddy's Money]]\"; the album was also certified gold in the United States.\n\nThe band followed its debut album with 1997's ''[[Blink of an Eye (Ricochet album)|Blink of an Eye]]'', which also produced several hits on the country music charts. A third album, titled ''What a Ride'', was slated for release in 1997, but was not released; however, their 2000 album ''What You Leave Behind'' contained tracks from this cancelled album. After being dropped from Columbia in 2001, Ricochet released a live album on an independent label. Ricochet's latest album ''15 years and Counting'' has produced the crowd favorite \"Sweet Tea\".\n\nRicochet's membership has changed significantly over time. Of the original six members, only Heath Wright remains, alongside Chris Hempfling (vocals, drums), Rick Toops (vocals, keys), Bruce Bennett (vocals, bass) and Larry Hight (vocals, rhythm/lead guitar, steel, dobro and saxophone).\n\n==Beginnings==\nRicochet was founded in 1993 by brothers Jeff (born December 27, 1962) and Junior Bryant (born October 23, 1968), who at the time were members of a band called Lariat, in which Jeff played drums, and Junior played fiddle and mandolin. The two brothers had invited lead singer Heath Wright (born April 22, 1967) to join Lariat; although the other members of Lariat disbanded not long afterward, the Bryant brothers and Wright decided to form a new group known as Ricochet.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p182058|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ricochet biography |accessdate=2007-12-12 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\nThe three members held auditions to recruit additional members, finalizing in 1994 with a six-piece lineup composed of Jeff, Junior, and Heath, as well as Teddy Carr (steel guitar, tenor vocals) (born July 4, 1960), Greg Cook (bass guitar, bass vocals) (born January 28, 1965), and Eddie Kilgallon (keyboards, rhythm guitar, saxophone, baritone vocals) (born May 12, 1965).<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/425533663/ | title=Tight, soaring harmonies are a trademark of Ricochet's music | work=The Manhattan Mercury | date=June 21, 1998 | accessdate=November 29, 2020 | pages=18}}</ref> Under this lineup, Ricochet toured throughout the [[Southern United States]], where they soon became known for their high-energy, mainstream country music sound.

With the new members in place, Ricochet recorded the album ''What You Leave Behind'' in 2000; included on it were several tracks from the unreleased ''What a Ride'', most notably their cover of [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"[[Seven Bridges Road]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Two of the songs that were newly recorded for ''What You Leave Behind'' were also released as singles before the band exited Columbia's roster in 2000.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> In 2001, Eddie Kilgallion left the band to tour with [[Montgomery Gentry]]. The following year, Junior Bryant departed to spend time with his wife and children. A live album, titled ''The Live Album'', was issued in 2004 on the independent Cowtown Records label. In September 2008, the band released a compilation album entitled ''Ricochet Reloaded--Hits/Plus'', which includes a combination of their greatest hits and newly recorded material. The latest release in 2012 entitled ''15 Years and Counting'' is a compilation of Hits, fan favorites, and newly recorded material. In 2014, bassist Greg Cook left the band to become the Tour Manager for Ricochet's close friends, [[The Swon Brothers]], after the Swon's successful season on the hit show, ''The Voice''.\n\nJeff and Junior Bryant's nephew, [[Chase Bryant]], is also a singer.<ref name=\"lc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-opinion/ci_25593095/llcmf-roy-orbisons-grandson-chase-bryant-returns-music |title=LCCMF: Chase Bryant returns to music festival - las Cruces Sun-News |accessdate=August 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819125857/http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-opinion/ci_25593095/llcmf-roy-orbisons-grandson-chase-bryant-returns-music |archivedate=August 19, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"boot\">{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/chase-bryant-new-single-tour/ |title=Chase Bryant Chasing His Dreams With Single, Upcoming Tour |website=Theboot.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!
