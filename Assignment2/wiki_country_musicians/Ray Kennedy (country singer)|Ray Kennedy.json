Kennedy played as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for Arsenal and then played as a left-sided [[midfielder]] for Liverpool. He scored 148 goals in 581 league and cup appearances in a 15-year career in the [[English Football League]]. Also, he won 17 [[Cap (sport)|cap]]s for [[England national football team|England]] between 1976 and 1980, scoring three international goals.\n\nKennedy turned professional for Arsenal in November 1968. He made his first-team debut 10 months later and went on to win the [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] in 1970, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and [[FA Cup]] Double in 1970\u201371, and then play on the losing side in the [[1972 FA Cup final]]. His form then declined, and he was sold to Liverpool for a club record [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]200,000 fee in July 1974, at the same time that [[Bill Shankly]] resigned as [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. He initially struggled at the club, but after manager [[Bob Paisley]] converted him to a left-sided midfielder, he went on to help Liverpool become the dominant club in English football from 1975 to 1982. During his time at the club Liverpool won the First Division five times (1975\u201376, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, and 1981\u201382), the [[FA Community Shield|FA Charity Shield]] four times (1976, 1977, 1979 and 1980), the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] three times, (1977, 1978, and 1981), and the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] (1976), [[UEFA Super Cup]] (1977), and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] (1981). He also picked up runners-up medals in the FA Cup (1977), UEFA Super Cup (1978), League Cup (1978), and [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|World Club Championship]] (1981) and won the ''[[Match of the Day]]'''s [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]] award in 1978\u201379.\n\nHe was a strong player with an excellent first touch, intelligence, and all-round ability. This allowed him to transition from a forward to a midfielder at Liverpool. Despite his trophy successes with Arsenal and Liverpool, after winning six caps for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-23]] side, he could not translate his club form into a good international career. He was used as a stand-in for [[Trevor Brooking]] before he retired from international football in frustration in March 1981. His only international tournament appearance was at [[UEFA Euro 1980|Euro 1980]]. Bob Paisley described him as \"one of Liverpool's greatest players and probably the most underrated\".\n\nKennedy joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] for a \u00a3160,000 fee in January 1982 and added a [[Welsh Cup]] winners medal to his collection four months later. However, the effects of [[Parkinson's disease]] began to reduce his effectiveness on the [[Football pitch|pitch]], and he dropped into the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] with [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] in November 1983. During the 1984\u201385 season, he spent a brief time as [[Player-coach|player-manager]] of [[Cyprus]] club [[Pezoporikos Larnaca FC|Pezoporikos]] and later played for [[Northern Football League|Northern League]] club [[Ashington A.F.C.|Ashington]]. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 1984. His life after football was difficult, as he had to deal with the effects of Parkinson's, the loss of his business, and the breakdown of his 15-year marriage. He remained reliant on charity to fund his medical expenses and was forced to sell his medal collection and caps in 1993.\n\n==Club career==\nRay Kennedy was born on 28 July 1951 in [[Seaton Delaval]], a former [[pit village]] in [[Northumberland]], to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and housewife, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=10}}</ref> He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=26}}</ref> He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a [[Scout (association football)|scout]] at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] and began training at [[Vale Park]] after [[Manager (association football)|manager]] [[Stanley Matthews]] came to the Kennedy home to persuade him to sign schoolboy forms at the club.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Kennedy File|url=http://www.lfchistory.net/images/newspapers/magazines/various/raykennedy-diary.jpg|website=lfchistory.net|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref> However, at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was \"too slow to be a footballer\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwin|first=Phil|title=The Port Vale Miscellany|publisher=The History Press|location=Brimscombe Port|year=2010|pages=16|isbn=978-0-7524-5777-2}}</ref> Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson said he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster.<ref name=\"Tale\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Tales: A Collection Of Stories, Anecdotes And Memories|publisher=Witan Books|date=December 1991|pages=98|isbn=978-0-9508981-6-2}}</ref> The club released him after being told that he would never make it as a professional.<ref name=\"Tale\" />\n\nKennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=44}}</ref> The pair scored 142 goals between them and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.<ref>{{harvnb|Lees|1993|p=45}}</ref>\n\n===Arsenal===\n\nKennedy was spotted by [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] playing for New Hartley Juniors.
