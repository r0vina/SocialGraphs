Wikipedia synopsis should be simple and to the point.--->\n\nIn the 1980s in [[Boston]], [[Irish Mob]] boss Frank Costello introduces himself to a young Colin Sullivan.\n\nMany years later, Sullivan has been groomed as a [[Espionage|spy]] inside the [[Massachusetts State Police]] (MSP) and joins the Special Investigation Unit (SIU). Another police academy recruit, Billy Costigan, is selected by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam [[Cover (intelligence gathering)|to go undercover]] as a criminal.\n\nCostigan serves a term in prison to set up his cover and further commits a series of crimes. Sullivan begins dating Madolyn Madden, a psychiatrist. Costigan catches Costello's attention, and Costello later recruits Costigan into his organization. Over the next year, Costigan becomes increasingly involved in the organization. His mental state declines but Queenan and Dignam convince him to continue. Costigan begins having appointments with Madden.\n\nThe MSP and Costello both realize that there is a mole in their respective organizations and task Costigan and Sullivan to find the moles. Meanwhile, Costigan learns that Costello is a protected [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Police informant|informant]]. Costigan shares his discovery with Queenan. Costigan and Madden have an affair.\n\nOne night, Costigan follows Costello into an [[adult movie theater|adult theater]] and witnesses him giving Sullivan an envelope containing information of his crew. Costigan is instructed to get a visual ID of Sullivan but he is unable to get a good look at his face. When Sullivan realizes that he is being followed, he accidentally stabs a man, mistaking him for Costigan, and flees. Queenan advises Sullivan to follow Costello to find the MSP mole. Costigan calls Queenan and sets up a meeting to end the undercover operation, but Sullivan has Queenan followed, lying to the other officers that Queenan may be the spy. Sullivan also calls in Costello's gang to the meeting location.\n\nWhen Costello's men arrive, Queenan helps Costigan escape before being thrown from the building to his death. This causes a firefight between police and Costello's men. Angered by Queenan's murder, Dignam attacks Sullivan and is suspended. Timothy Delahunt, one of Costello's henchmen who was wounded in the gunfight, tells Costigan that he knows he is the rat before he succumbs to his wounds. Sullivan looks through Queenan's belongings and learns that Costello is an FBI informant after reading Queenan's notebook. A news report reveals that Delahunt was an undercover officer for the [[Boston Police Department]], but Costello suspects the police department made up the claim so he would stop looking for the mole. Deciding to turn on him, Sullivan directs the MSP to tail Costello, and a gunfight erupts, killing most of Costello's crew. Sullivan confronts a wounded Costello, who admits to being an FBI informant. They exchange gunfire, and Sullivan kills him.\n\nHis assignment finished, Costigan goes to Sullivan to reveal his undercover status, still unaware of the other's true identity. After Sullivan goes to another room, Costigan notices the same envelope from the theater on his desk. Costigan realizes that Sullivan was Costello's mole, and escapes. Shortly after, Sullivan returns to find Costigan gone, and realizes that he now knows his true identity. He deletes Costigan's records from police computers. Costigan visits Madden, who has revealed that she's pregnant to Sullivan but not to Costigan knowing that Sullivan may not be the father, and hands her an envelope, instructing her to open it if something happens to him. She finds an envelope in the mail from Costigan addressed to Sullivan. Inside is a CD of Costello's recorded conversations with Sullivan. Scared that Costigan has revealed their affair, she listens to the taped conversations and leaves Sullivan. Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan on the rooftop of the building where Queenan was killed, then arrests him. Costigan calls Trooper Brown, an acquaintance from the [[police academy]], but Brown pulls a gun on Costigan when he arrives, unsure who is telling the truth.\n\nCostigan says that he has evidence tying Sullivan to Costello, and Brown lets him go down the elevator. Upon reaching the lobby, Costigan is shot in the head by Trooper Barrigan, a friend of Sullivan's who reveals himself to be another spy working for Costello. Brown reaches the lobby but is shot dead by Barrigan as well. Sullivan shoots Barrigan dead, allowing him to denounce Barrigan as the mole while removing suspicion from himself.\n\nAt Costigan's funeral, Sullivan and Madden stand by his grave. As Madden silently cries, Sullivan realizes that they were involved. He attempts to talk to her, but she ignores him. Later, when Sullivan arrives home, Dignam is waiting for him inside and, after Sullivan indifferently accepts his fate, Dignam shoots him in the head, avenging Queenan's and Costigan's deaths, before he leaves. The final shot shows a rat crawling on the rail of the patio with the [[Massachusetts State House]] in the distance.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast is in credits order and named as credited; please do not change. -->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Trooper William \"Billy\" Costigan Jr.\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Staff Sergeant Colin Sullivan\n* [[Jack Nicholson]] as Francis \"Frank\" Costello\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Captain Oliver \"Charlie\" Queenan\n* [[Ray Winstone]] as Arnold \"Frenchie\" French\n* [[Vera Farmiga]] as Dr. Madolyn Madden\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Captain George Ellerby\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as Trooper Brown\n* [[Kevin Corrigan]] as Sean Costigan\n* [[James Badge Dale]] as Trooper Barrigan\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Patrick \"Fitzy\" Fitzgibbons\n* [[Mark Rolston]] as Timothy Delahunt\n* [[Robert Wahlberg]] as FBI Special Agent Frank Lazio \n* Amanda Lynch as Carmen\n* [[Kristen Dalton (actress)|Kristen Dalton]] as Gwen\n* [[Shay Duffin]] as Phil\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Martin Scorsese Berlinale 2010 (cropped2).jpg|thumb|274x274px|Martin Scorsese, the director of the film, in 2010]]\nIn January 2003, [[Warner Bros.]], producer [[Brad Grey]], and actor/producer [[Brad Pitt]] bought the rights to remake the Hong Kong film ''[[Infernal Affairs]]'' (2002) from [[Media Asia Entertainment Group|Media Asia]] for $1.75 million.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Zorianna |last1=Kit |first2=Chris |last2=Gardner |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-97614647/warners-pays-have-affairs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054104/http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-97614647/warners-pays-have-affairs|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 21, 2013 |title=Warners pays to have ''Affairs'' |magazine=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Eldridge Industries]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=February 3, 2003 |access-date=November 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=filmmaker>{{cite web |first=Dade |last=Hayes |url=https://variety.com/2006/film/news/brad-pitt-s-role-as-filmmaker-threatens-to-eclipse-his-actorly-exploits-and-tabloid-profile-1117955806/ |title=Brad Pitt's role as filmmaker threatens to eclipse his actorly exploits and tabloid profile |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=December 14, 2006 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108184416/https://variety.com/2006/film/news/brad-pitt-s-role-as-filmmaker-threatens-to-eclipse-his-actorly-exploits-and-tabloid-profile-1117955806/|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> [[William Monahan]] was secured as a screenwriter, and later [[Martin Scorsese]], who admired Monahan's script, came on board as director.<ref name=filmmaker /><ref name=directors /><ref name=pitt>{{cite magazine |first=Elvis |last=Mitchell |author-link=Elvis Mitchell |url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/brad-pitt |title=Brad Pitt's Great Escape |magazine=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |publisher=Crystal Ball Media |location=New York City |date=February 2007 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108190212/https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/brad-pitt|archive-date=November 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2004, [[United Press International]] announced that Scorsese would be remaking ''Infernal Affairs'' and setting it in Boston, and that Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star.<ref name=upi>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2004/03/02/Leo-DiCaprio-Brad-Pitt-lead-Affairs/UPI-62891078255749/ |title=Leo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt lead ''Affairs'' |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date=March 2, 2004 |access-date=November 8, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107015320/https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2004/03/02/Leo-DiCaprio-Brad-Pitt-lead-Affairs/UPI-62891078255749/|archive-date=November 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Pitt, tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan, later declined to play the role, saying a younger actor should play the part; he decided to produce the film instead.<ref name=pitt /> Scorsese's associate [[Kenneth Lonergan]] suggested Matt Damon, who grew up in Boston, for the part of Sullivan, and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello.<ref name=directors /> [[Robert De Niro]] was approached to play Queenan, but De Niro declined in order to direct ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'' instead.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/leonardo-dicaprio-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro-movie |title=Can Martin Scorsese Just Make a Movie with Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio Already?

Departed''' (also known as '''Cody Canada and the Departed''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band. The band was formed in 2011 by [[Cody Canada]], the former lead vocalist and guitarist for [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada (guitars and lead vocals), Jeremy Plato (bass guitar and vocals), and [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] (drums).\n\n==Formation==\nAfter Oklahoma based southern rock band [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] broke up in 2010, [[Cody Canada]] decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a \"Super Group.\" Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma]] native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves \"The Departed\" as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as \"Cody Canada and The Departed\" namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview.\n\n==''This Is Indian Land''==\nThe band released its first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'' through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The band's cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song \"Staring Down the Sun\" was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, \"The Ballad of Rosalie\" and \"Skyline Radio\" both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.\n\n==''Advent\u016bs''==\nOn August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, ''Advent\u016bs'' (Latin for \"arrival\") on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an [[alternative rock]] and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: \"Worth The Fight\", \"Prayer For the Lonely\" and \"Flagpole\".\n\n==''HippieLovePunk'' & Line-Up Changes==\nIn September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. \"After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/cody-canada-announces-the-departed-lineup-changes-new-solo-acoustic-live-album-due-this-fall/article/3883601 |title=Cody Canada announces The Departed lineup changes, new solo acoustic live album due this fall |author= Brandy McDonnell |date= September 16, 2013 |work=NewsOK }}</ref> The band continued performing as a four-piece group.\n\nIn 2014, the band finished a new album, ''HippieLovePunk''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/5-minutes-in-texas-with-cody-canada-20140721 |title=5 Minutes in Texas With Cody Canada|author= Jim Casey |date=July 21, 2014 |magazine= Rolling Stone }}</ref> It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top [[Alternative Country]] Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week.

[[East Texas]] native Ross Smith replaced Littleton on keyboards and took up rhythm guitars, while [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] became the drummer in place of Doege. In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song \"All Nighter\" on ''HippieLovePunk'' at John T. Floore's Country Store in [[Helotes, Texas]]. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for [[Micky and the Motorcars]] Mark McCoy, who had died in [[Idaho]] in 2012 while on vacation. The songs \"Inbetweener\" and \"Easy\" were released as singles.\n\n==''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect''==\nIn early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named ''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect'', honoring 1960s era country music with songs by [[Johnny Paycheck]], Stonewall Jackson and [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]], among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly's]] Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.\n\n==''3''==\nIn early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3 piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single \"Lipstick\" from their new album ''3'', that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. [[Mike McClure]], who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweed's albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd album of original content as '''In Retrospect''', and '''Indian Land''' had both been cover albums.\n\n==Current==\nDue to the band's current lineup, several popular Cross Canadian Ragweed songs have made their way back into the Departed's nightly set list in addition to the new material the band has written. Canada said in a 2018 Rolling Stone interview that he was \"truly happy with the way the band is now and I feel this is the band I have always wanted, and really deserved.\"\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Independent Albums|US<br />Indie]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Independent Albums}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Independent Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''This Is Indian Land''\n| \n* Release date: June 21, 2011\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 13\n| 68\n| 11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Advent\u016bs''\n| \n* Release date: November 13, 2012\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 19\n| 133\n| 16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''HippieLovePunk''\n| \n* Release date: January 13, 2015\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 9\n| 136\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''3''\n| \n* Release date: June 29, 2018\n* Label: Red 11 Music\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
