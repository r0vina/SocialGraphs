The series details the life of the Bennetts, a dysfunctional family consisting of brothers Colt and Rooster, their father Beau, and their mother Maggie who owns the local bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-netflix-comedy-series-the-ranch-1201446202/|title=Ashton Kutcher & Danny Masterson To Star In Netflix Series From '2.5 Men' Duo|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=June 17, 2015|access-date=June 22, 2015|archive-date=January 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117033017/https://deadline.com/2015/06/ashton-kutcher-danny-masterson-netflix-comedy-series-the-ranch-1201446202/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Colt Reagan Bennett, a former star quarterback for his high school football team who returns to his hometown after a fifteen-year absence to help his father and older brother on their family ranch while waiting for a tryout with a new semi-pro team in Denver. In the first episode, Colt reveals that he was the third-string quarterback for the [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] team that won the [[Bowl Championship Series|National Championship]] in 1999. He pursued a professional career with little success, never finding regular playing time or stardom even on semi-pro teams, but hanging on in backup roles and on [[practice squad]]s. Colt is frequently the butt of jokes, particularly when it comes to his lack of ranching skills, sub-par intelligence, and unsuccessful pro football career. He is a [[Alcohol abuse|heavy drinker]] and has a habit of not using common sense, often acting before he thinks, but he is friendly and cares about other people deep down. Based on his various T-shirts and dialogue, it's implied Colt has played for the [[Barcelona Dragons (NFL Europe)|Barcelona Dragons]], [[San Jose SaberCats]], [[Spokane Shock]], [[Orlando Predators]], [[Nebraska Danger]], [[Sioux City Bandits]], [[Iowa Barnstormers]], [[Green Bay Blizzard]], [[Minnesota Axemen]], [[Portland Forest Dragons]] and [[Philadelphia Soul]]. Dialogue and team gear also indicate that he was a member of teams in [[Canada]], notably the [[Ottawa Redblacks]] and fictional [[Saskatoon]] Cold (\"Like the [[Miami Heat]]... only cold\"). He has also played on teams in [[Alaska]] and was a member of the [[Buffalo Bills]] practice squad. He later marries Abby, his high school sweetheart, and they become the parents of a daughter they name Peyton.\n* [[Danny Masterson]] as Jameson \"Rooster\" Ford Bennett (seasons 1\u20133), Colt's older brother. He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career, at times showing a bitter attitude for accepting the responsibility while Colt pursued his dream. Despite living in Colt's shadow, he is far more competent on the ranch and a more rational thinker. He has, however, been just as immature as Colt, drinking too much and slacking off. In the first half of part 5, Rooster gets into a rivalry with his ex-girlfriend Mary's intimidating boyfriend Nick, and in the second episode of Part 6, it is discovered that Rooster's motorcycle went off the side of a dangerous road; he is missing and presumed dead.\n* [[Debra Winger]] as Maggie Bennett, owner of Maggie's bar, and Colt and Rooster's mother. Maggie is at first [[Marital separation|separated]] and later [[divorce]]d from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns. Maggie is a free-thinker, an environmentalist, and an avid [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] smoker. Much more patient and laid-back than Beau, Colt and Rooster often seek her company and advice on how to deal with problems, especially those concerning Beau.\n* [[Sam Elliott]] as Beau Roosevelt Bennett, Maggie's ex-husband, and Colt and Rooster's father. A [[Vietnam War]] veteran, he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died. He is a curmudgeon, constantly annoyed with everyone and everything. He has a strained relationship with Rooster and Colt. He hates modern amenities and is easily angered by Colt and Rooster's antics. Beau appears to be a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] with a soft-spot for [[Ronald Reagan]] but at times seems to despise all politicians regardless of affiliation.\n* [[Elisha Cuthbert]] as Abby Phillips-Bennett (seasons 2\u20134; recurring, season 1), a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt's high school sweetheart. As the series begins, Abby has been in a five-year relationship with Kenny Ballard and briefly becomes engaged to him. As the series progresses, she breaks off her engagement to Kenny to reconnect with Colt, ultimately marrying Colt and having a baby girl, Peyton, with him.\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Barry Corbin]] as Dale Rivers, a hearing-impaired veterinarian and close friend of Beau's\n* Grady Lee Richmond as Hank McGinty, a regular Maggie's patron; also brother to Father McGinty\n* [[Bret Harrison]] as Kenny Ballard, a [[Courtyard by Marriott]] manager, former classmate of Colt and Abby, and Abby's ex-fianc\u00e9\n* [[Megyn Price]] as Mary Roth, a [[Cracker Barrel]] waitress and Rooster's love interest; she later has a relationship with Luke after Rooster disappears\n* [[Kelli Goss]] as Heather Roth, Mary's younger daughter and Colt's brief love interest\n* [[Molly McCook]] as Darlene Roth, Mary's older daughter\n* [[Kathy Baker]] as Joanne, Beau's girlfriend following his divorce, and Mary's coworker at the Cracker Barrel\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as \"Beer Pong\" Billy Tompkins, a Sheriff's Deputy, and high school friend of Colt and Rooster's\n* Justin Mooney as Deputy Wilkerson, a former schoolmate of Colt and Rooster's with whom Colt has an antagonistic rapport\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Nikki, Heather's friend and Billy's fianc\u00e9e\n* [[Chasty Ballesteros]] as Tanya Showers, a weather reporter and Kenny's girlfriend following his breakup with Abby\n* Laura Vallejo as Maria, a Maggie's waitress\n* [[Sharon Lawrence]] as Brenda Sanders, a widowed hairdresser who befriended Beau when he and Maggie separated\n* Dawan Owens as Rich, a Neumann's Hill employee who is briefly Rooster's supervisor\n* [[Maggie Lawson]] as Jen, an engineer who wants to build a pipeline underneath the Bennett Ranch and Rooster's brief love interest\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Lisa Neumann, owner of the Neumann's Hill ranching corporation\n* [[Dax Shepard]] as Luke Matthews, the son of Beau's late brother Greg who arrives after Rooster's disappearance\n* [[Stephen Saux]] as Mike, a motel manager, first seen at the Thomas Rhett concert\n* Van Epperson as Father McGinty, a Priest who performs the wedding ceremony for Beau and Joanne and Peyton's baptism; also brother to Hank McGinty\n* Travis Case as Toby Henderson, Colt's high school classmate, who runs the neighboring Henderson Ranch\n* Josh Burrow as Nick, Mary's abusive ex-husband\n* [[Casey Sander]] as Roger Hollister, Colt's neighboring rancher\n\n===Special guests===\n* [[Jon Cryer]] as Bill Jensen (seasons 1\u20132), a loan officer and former high school football referee\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Umberto (seasons 1\u20132), a former Iron River ranch hand\n* [[Martin Mull]] as Jerry, Maggie's sometimes acid-tripping attorney\n* [[John Amos]] as Ed Bishop (seasons 1\u20132), a longtime family friend of the Bennetts and a Neumann's Hill employee\n* [[Thomas F.
