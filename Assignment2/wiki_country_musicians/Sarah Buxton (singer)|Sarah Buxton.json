She became actively involved in music as a child by learning piano, playing flute and joining a children's choir. As she learned more about music, she became interested in songwriters and began writing poetry. After graduation, she met one of her musical idols, [[Stevie Nicks]], who encouraged her to pursue music and move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nBuxton enrolled at Nashville's [[Belmont University]]<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> and started a Southern rock band called Stoik Oak, which toured the region for three years. After an 18-month engagement, she married Christopher Robin of the Christopher Robin Band when she was 22. However, they divorced shortly{{when|date=December 2021}} afterwards. She also felt discouraged about finding a place for her voice in the music business but found further encouragement from one of her friends, [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] of [[Big & Rich]]. She asked her publisher to set up some co-writing sessions, and she became more confident in her approach to singing and songwriting.
