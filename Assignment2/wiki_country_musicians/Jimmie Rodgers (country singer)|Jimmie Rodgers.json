Widely regarded as the \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Father of Country Music]]\", he is best known for his distinctive [[yodeling]]. Rodgers was known as \"The Singing Brakeman\" and \"America's [[Blue yodeling|Blue Yodeler]]\". He has been cited as an inspiration by many artists, and he has been inducted into multiple halls of fame.\n\nOriginally from [[Meridian, Mississippi]], Rodgers was the son of railroad worker Aaron Rodgers. During his early childhood, the family moved according to the needs of his father's employment, or Rodgers' own poor health. As a teenager, he was musically influenced by the diverse [[vaudeville]] shows that he often attended. At the age of 13, Rodgers won a local singing contest, and then traveled through the Southern United States with a [[medicine show]]. After his father took him back home to Meridian, Rodgers dropped out of school and joined the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]], starting as a [[waterboy]] on his father's gang. He eventually became a [[brakeman]], among other functions he performed. During his time working with different railroad companies, the singer further developed his musical style; he was influenced by the [[gandy dancer]]s and their impromptu [[blues]] performances. Rodgers was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] in 1924. By 1927, he stopped working for the railroad as a result of his health and decided to focus on his music career.\n\nIn 1927, Rodgers joined [[the Tenneva Ramblers]] band, who at the time were working at a radio station. After the band was fired from their spot, they worked in different resorts in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. There, Rodgers became aware of the [[field recording]]s that [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]'s engineer [[Ralph Peer]] was to undertake in [[Bristol, Tennessee]]. During what later became known as the [[Bristol sessions]], Rodgers recorded solo, as he was deserted by his band after a disagreement. A second session with Rodgers was later arranged in [[Camden, New Jersey]], at the singer's own insistence; that session produced \"[[Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas)]]\". The song became a success, propelling Rodgers to national fame and beginning his recording career with the label, during which he produced over 100 songs.\n\n== Early life ==\nThe Rodgers family migrated to the United States from England and Ireland before the [[American Revolution]]. They settled around the [[Appalachian Mountains]], and later moved to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Western United States|Western]] United States. Both of Jimmie Rodgers' grandfathers served in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the war, his maternal grandfather settled in [[Meridian, Mississippi]], while his paternal grandfather settled around [[Geiger, Alabama]].{{sfn|Wynne, Ben|2014|p=91, 92}} Rodgers' father, Aaron, worked for the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]]. He eventually became a foreman, and, in 1884, he married Eliza Bozeman. The couple lived in the railroad work camps as Aaron Rodgers moved through different locations along the line. The Rodgers family then temporarily settled in the community of Pine Springs, north of Meridian.{{sfn|Wynne, Ben|2014|p=91, 92}}\n\nCharles James \"Jimmie\" Rodgers was born on September 8, 1897.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=12}} His place of birth is disputed: Meridian{{Emdash}}which Rodgers often called his home town{{sfn|Wynne, Ben|2014|p=93}}{{Emdash}}is most often listed in records, while Rodgers would later sign a document that named Geiger, Alabama.{{sfn|Brown, Alan|2015|p=33}} Incapable of living in the unsanitary conditions of the camps, Rodgers' mother decided to stay in Pine Springs while her husband frequently worked for long periods and returned home when he could.{{sfn|Wynne, Ben|2014|p=94}} After two miscarriages, her health began to fail.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=12}} She became sick and Aaron Rodgers quit his job at the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and started farming to be closer to his wife. She died in 1903. Then-six-year-old Jimmie Rodgers was deeply affected by his mother's death.{{sfn|Wynne, Ben|2014|p=94}} Rodgers was sent, along with his brother Talmage, to live with relatives of his father in [[Scooba, Mississippi]], and later to Geiger.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=12}} Rodgers attended school irregularly during his early childhood; he did not attend at all for a time following the death of his mother. After the family moved to [[Lowndes County, Mississippi]], he and his brother went to school in the town of [[Artesia, Mississippi|Artesia]]. Rodgers and his brother often arrived late to school or missed it altogether as a result of road conditions and other distractions. Rodgers often missed classes during the winter due to his tendency to suffer from colds and respiratory issues.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=12-15}}\n\nHis father remarried and the family moved to Meridian, where Rodgers was enrolled at the local high school. He and his siblings had problems with their new step-mother. When his father returned to work for the railroad, Rodgers again rarely went to school.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=15}} Instead, he and his brother Jake went to the local theaters to see [[vaudeville]] shows and watch movies. As a result, Rodgers became interested in the entertainment industry. To support his expenditures, he sold newspapers and molasses, or he [[Begging|panhandled]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=16}} In 1906, he was sent to live with his older brother Talmage and their aunt Dora Bozeman in Pine Springs, while his brother Jake was sent to other relatives. The routine of the Bozeman household grounded Rodgers with chores and he spent most of his free time outdoors.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=18}} He started to attend school regularly and he was further assisted by his teacher, who rented a room at his aunt's boarding house.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=19}} Rodgers received most of his schooling while he lived there until he went back to Meridian in 1911.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Jimmie Rodgers in 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Rodgers in a 1921 portrait|alt=Autographed black and white picture of a man (Jimmie Rodgers) dressed in a striped suit, a white shirt, and wearing a tie and a beret. Sitting down, he holds the guitar to his chest resting the body on the right side and raising the neck while playing a C chord]]\nUpon his return to Meridian, he went back to the streets. He frequented the barbershop of his uncle Tom Bozeman and he often slept during the daytime in the upstairs apartment. He organized a neighborhood carnival that played the nearby towns. Rodgers' appearances made enough money to pay for the sheets he used as a tent. He then organized a second show, which he financed with his father's money, unbeknownst to him. Rodgers then won a contest at the local Elite Theater for his performance of the songs \"[[Steamboat Bill]]\" and \"I Wonder Why Bill Bailey Don't Come Home\". Following his success, Rodgers started to perform with a [[medicine show]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=22}} He quit the show some weeks later as they reached [[Birmingham, Alabama]], claiming the [[proprietor]] did not treat him well. At the age of thirteen, he started working for a tailor in [[West Blocton, Alabama]], until, months later, his father took him back to Meridian with the intention of enrolling him at a new school. Soon after, his step-mother died. Instead of attending school, Rodgers followed his father to learn his profession with the working crews of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=23}}\n\nRodgers started working for the railroad as a waterboy for the black [[gandy dancer]] crews, who introduced him to the railroad jargon, their work songs, and banjo playing.{{sfn|Greenway, John|p=232|1957}} Eventually, he became a baggage handler and then a brakeman.{{sfn|Barkley, Elizabeth|2007|p=175}} He moved often while working on the lines from Mississippi to Texas.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=27}} In January 1917, he was introduced by a friend to Stella Kelly in [[Durant, Mississippi]]. At the time, he was moving between [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[New Orleans]] without a stable location. He maintained the lines, checked baggage and at times worked as a dishwasher at a local restaurant in Durant. He and Kelly married on April 6, 1917.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=30-32}} The newlyweds left Durant after Rodgers' job as an apprentice mechanic failed to work out and moved to [[Louisville, Mississippi]], where he again worked as a brakeman. After his marriage fell apart, Rodgers started working for the [[New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad]] (NO&NE).{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=33-35}} He spent time in both Meridian and New Orleans. Rodgers was fired from the NO&NE in 1920 and he worked odd jobs. In the early 1920s, he returned to work stints on the railway lines where he had previously worked, as well as on the [[Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railway]]. He worked mainly as a brakeman, but he also performed other functions, including [[Flagman (rail)|flagman]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=41-42}}\n\n==Music career==\nIn 1924, Rodgers was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 27. The disease affected his ability to perform his work and he chose to move with his wife and children to [[Arizona]], following the medical advice of the time, which suggested high and dry places to ease the symptoms. Then, Rodgers moved to [[Asheville, North Carolina]].{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=22}} As he worked less on the railroads and his foreman complained of his extended absences, he returned to performing music. Rodgers formed a jazz-style band that performed pop standards with the inclusion of horns and the piano accompaniment of his new wife Carrie McWilliams' sister, [[Elsie McWilliams]].{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=23}} The group played on the road in tents, on city streets and in various other small locations without any commercial success.{{sfn|Kingsbury, Paul|McCall, Michael|Rumble, John|Gill, Vince|2012|p=454}} In 1927, Rodgers left his work on the railroad. In Asheville, he met the Grant Brothers, who led the mountain music string band the Tenneva Ramblers.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=22}} Rodgers convinced the group to join him as the Jimmie Rodgers Entertainers, with him as the lead singer for a recurrent, unpaid spot he managed to obtain at [[WWNC]].{{sfn|Kingsbury, Paul|McCall, Michael|Rumble, John|Gill, Vince|2012|p=454}} The band was composed of Rodgers (vocals and guitar), Claude Grant (vocals and guitar), Jack Grant (mandolin), Jack Pierce (fiddle) and, at times, Claude Sagle (banjo).{{sfn|Lornell, Kip|2021|p=84}}\n\n[[File:Jimmie Rodgers Entertainers.jpg|The Jimmie Rodgers Entertainers (Rodgers, second from the left, holding a banjo)|thumb|upright|alt=Black and white studio portrait of four men smiling while holding musical instruments: Three men play banjos and one of the back to the right plays a guitar. Jimmie Rodgers is seen second from the left wearing glasses and wearing a tan suit while holding up his banjo on his right knee as he raises his right leg on a chair. The two other men in the front sit in chairs facing each other sideways]]\n\nAfter the group was fired from the radio show, they found a job performing at a resort in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]]. There, Rodgers heard of [[Bristol sessions|the upcoming field recordings]] that engineer [[Ralph Peer]] of the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] was to undertake in [[Bristol, Tennessee]], in search of local talent.{{sfn|Kingsbury, Paul|McCall, Michael|Rumble, John|Gill, Vince|2012|p=454}} Rodgers made an appointment for the band to record with Peer on August 4, 1927. Before the scheduled recording, the band had a dispute with the singer regarding the name to be used on the label of the recording. The Tenneva Ramblers then deserted Rodgers, who convinced Peer to record him alone with his guitar.{{sfn|Kingsbury, Paul|McCall, Michael|Rumble, John|Gill, Vince|2012|p=454}} Peer later commented that he considered Rodgers an individualist, who, due to his blues-leaning style, was incompatible with the sound of the Tenneva Ramblers band, which based its music around the use of fiddles.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2015|pp=114-115}} By the end of Rodgers' session, Peer felt that although he liked the singer, he could not sign him to the label as he was performing pop music that belonged to New York publishers, instead of the original tunes that Peer was scouting for.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2015|p=115}} The session produced \"The Soldier's Sweetheart\", an adaptation of an old vaudeville tune with new lyrics by Rodgers, and a version of the showtune, \"Sleep, Baby, Sleep\".{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2015|p=116}}\n\nAfter the session, Peer told Rodgers that he would contact him at a later date to hear new original material.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2015|p=115}} Rodgers then moved with his family to Washington, D.C., and the record sold some copies. After a month of not hearing back from Peer, Rodgers decided to travel to New York City, where he checked into the [[The Michelangelo|Manger Hotel]] and called the producer to let him know that he was ready to undertake his next recording session.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2015|p=117}} Impressed by Rodgers' boldness, Peer set an appointment for November 30, 1927, at Studio 1 of the Victor Talking Machine Company in [[Camden, New Jersey]]. The first few numbers that Rodgers tried did not appeal to Peer, as they were once again not original material. Rodgers then attempted a number he had been working on using yodeling, which Peer called \"[[Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas)|Blue Yodel]]\".{{sfn|Barker, Hugh|Taylor, Yuval|2007|p=112}}\n\nWhen \"The Soldier's Sweetheart\" / \"Sleep, Baby, Sleep\" record started to sell well, Victor decided to advance the release of \"Blue Yodel\".{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=132}} In Washington, D.C., Rodgers worked a stint for the station WTTF with the backing of the \"Jimmie Rodgers' Southerners\", while he continued to make records for the label. He used the band for his recordings of \"[[In the Jailhouse Now]]\" and \"The Brakeman's Blues\", among others.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=101}}\n\n{{Listen |filename=Blue Yodel No. 1 intro.ogg|title=Blue Yodel No. 1|description=Excerpt of Rodgers' most successful recording, \"Blue Yodel No. 1\"}}\nAs 1928 progressed, \"Blue Yodel\" became a major success.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=95}} The song marked the first of a series of [[blue yodel]]s.{{sfn|Greenway, John|p=231|1957}} The unknown origin of Rodgers' yodel has been attributed to several sources, including traditional alpine songs, its use by gandy dancers and its use in vaudeville and [[minstrel show]]s.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=125}} The yodels presented a main character who often exaggerated his qualities as a lover, threatening other men who try to take his woman or declaring that he can easily find another one, and vocalizing verses that deal with promiscuity and violence, often using [[double entendre]]s.{{sfn|Greenway, John|p=233|1957}} With the release of further songs of the series,\"Blue Yodel\" was later renamed on the catalogs to \"Blue Yodel No. 1 (T for Texas)\".{{sfn|Paramount Music Co.|1928|p=7}} \"Blue Yodel No. 1\" became the singer's most successful recording, with over a million copies sold during his lifetime.{{sfn|Bond, Johnny|1978|p=V}}{{sfn|Malone, Bill|Laird, Tracey|2018|p=98}} Soon, Rodgers' show billed him as \"America's Blue Yodeler\".{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=124}}\n\nFollowing the release of \"If Brother Jack Were Here\", Victor was threatened with a lawsuit by [[Joseph W. Stern & Co.]] for copyright infringement of their original composition \"Mother Was a Lady\".{{sfn|Paris, Mike|Comber, Chris|1981|p=202}} As a result, the label renamed the record and Peer began to carefully assess the material brought by Rodgers. The singer often arrived to the recording sessions short of material and he resorted to passing off old vaudeville and minstrel show songs as his own. After Peer rejected several songs, Rodgers contacted his sister-in-law, Elsie McWilliams, to help him with the composition of new material. Few of the songs credited to Rodgers were authored by himself; McWilliams wrote most of his Blue Yodels and Rodgers also hired amateur composers to write other songs.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=118, 119}}{{sfn|Peterson, Richard|2013|p=45}} With McWilliams' help, he would also write compositions of his own, which she remarked Rodgers would not stop working on until they \"sounded just right\".{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=146}} With the sales of his records still improving after the release of \"In the Jailhouse Now\", Rodgers embarked on a tour of the United States: he appeared on the Southern Time circuit of [[Loews Cineplex Entertainment|Loews Theaters]] and the East Coast circuit of [[Paramount Pictures#Publix, Balaban and Katz, Loew's competition and wonder theaters|Publix Theaters]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=158}} The pairing of \"Blue Yodel No. 4 (California Blues)\" / \"[[Waiting for a Train (Jimmie Rodgers song)|Waiting for a Train]]\" became popular due to the success of the [[A-side and B-side|flipside]] record. The recording would eventually become Rodgers' second best seller of his career, with a total of 365,000 copies sold during his lifetime.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=162}}{{sfn|Malone, Bill|Laird, Tracey|2018|p=98}}\n\nIn February 1929, Rodgers' health worsened. Against his doctor's consistent recommendations to rest, Rodgers proceeded with his tour. During a stop in Meridian, he suffered a fever. Rodgers intended to perform the show, but he collapsed on the dressing room floor shortly before its start.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=180}} His doctor ordered an [[x-ray]]{{Emdash}}an uncommon procedure at the time{{Emdash}}and determined that the singer was suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, which affected his lungs. Cavities were found on the top of both lungs, while the bottom of his right lung showed [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=184}} As they traveled through Texas performing, Jimmie and Carrie Rodgers stopped in [[Kerrville, Texas|Kerrville]]. The town offered the dry air and mild weather that the medical authorities of the time considered necessary for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]]. Kerrville was home to multiple [[sanatorium]]s and a [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Hospital]]<nowiki>, which specialized in pulmonary disease. As Rodgers was badly affected by the weather in Washington, D.C., Meridian and Asheville, he decided to settle in Kerrville. The construction of his new home began in April 1929. With a total cost of approximately $20,000 (</nowiki>{{Inflation|US|20000|1929|r=-4|fmt=eq}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}), he named it \"Blue Yodeler's Paradise\".{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=200-201}} With his move to Texas, Rodgers' on-stage attire changed. He had previously worn brakeman's working clothes, which he replaced with regular clothes and a cowboy hat.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=203}} On June 14, 1929, he performed at the inaugural event of [[San Antonio]]'s [[Majestic Theatre (San Antonio)|Majestic Theatre]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=205}}\n\n[[File:JimmieRodgers in 1929.png|thumb|upright|Rodgers in 1929|alt=Black and white studio portrait of Jimmie Rodgers sitting on a chair looking at the camera.

He holds a guitar to his right knee with his forearms with his right hand on top of the body and his left hand over the hole]]\n\nAt the height of this career, in 1929, Rodgers made approximately $75,000 ({{Inflation|US|75,000|1929|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}) in royalties. After the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Wall Street Crash that year]], while his records continued to sell, his royalties dropped to approximately $60,000 ({{Inflation|US|60,000|1929|fmt=eq|r=-4}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}).{{sfn|Peterson, Richard|2008|p=50}} \"Waiting for a Train\" continued to be popular, as the themes depicted in the song became commonplace in the lives of unemployed Americans during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].{{sfn|Perone, James|2016|p=81}} Through a number of field recording sessions{{Emdash}}made as his schedule and tour allowed it{{Emdash}}Rodgers increased his catalog. By November 1929, he had filmed ''[[The Singing Brakeman (film)|The Singing Brakeman]]'' at the RCA Victor studios in Camden.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|pp=92-94}} Continuing his tour, in late February 1930, Rodgers collapsed again during a stop in [[Carthage, Mississippi]]. After he suffered a hemorrhage, Rodgers followed his doctor's advice and canceled his third appearance at the local movie house. Despite his condition, Rodgers then joined a four-month tour with daily appearances on ''Swain's Hollywood Follies''. Rodgers and his musical troupe performed a total of 70 shows.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=234-235}} With few of his recordings left to be released, Rodgers headed to Los Angeles to produce new material in June\u2013July 1930.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=250}} The sessions produced, among other numbers, \"[[Mule Skinner Blues|Blue Yodel no. 8, Mule Skinner Blues]]\" and \"Blue Yodel No. 9 (Standin' on the Corner)\" featuring [[Louis Armstrong]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=258-259}} Rodgers commissioned Ray Hall, at the time a prisoner at the [[Huntsville Unit|Texas State Penitentiary]], to help him write the song \"T.B. Blues\" after McWilliams refused to help. Rodgers recorded and released the composition in 1931.{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=117}}\n\nIn the summer of 1931, Rodgers recorded two sides with the [[Carter Family]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=294}} That year, his health quickly deteriorated and his sales fell to an average of 30,000 copies per record as the Great Depression progressed.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=303}} Meanwhile, his excessive expenditures forced him to sell his Kerrville home.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=306}} \"Rodgers' Puzzle Record\", a compilation containing three recordings of the singer on one side, was released in England, India, and Australia in 1931.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=306}} The same year, the singer accepted an offer to make appearances, when available, on San Antonio radio station [[KSLR|KMAC]]'s Tuesday show. When he was on tour, ''The Jimmie Rodgers Show'' played his Victor recordings.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=312}}{{sfn|Mazor, Barry|2009|p=95}} In April 1932, he renegotiated his contract with the label: Rodgers was to receive $25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25,000|1931|fmt=eq|r=-3}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}) for 24 sides to be released monthly, with the singer receiving $250 ({{Inflation|US|250|1932|r=-1|fmt=eq}}{{Inflation/fn|US}}) in advance payment per side.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=322}}\n\n===Declining health and death===\nAs his health condition worsened, Rodgers reduced his appearances on tour schedules from five days to one per venue; he also camped in a tent, which allowed for better air circulation. A number of concerts were cut short because of his condition, while others were cancelled.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=323}} Until 1932, Peer took trips for field sessions to record Rodgers in Atlanta, New Orleans and Dallas. After RCA Victor ended his field sessions, Rodgers traveled to Camden, to record at the company's studios.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=329}} Rodgers managed to produce ten sides, with regular rest between takes. Realizing the state of health of the singer, Peer arranged a follow-up session to create a backlog for the Rodgers catalog.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=330-335}} Rodgers then returned to San Antonio, where he spent most of his time in bed until, in October of that year, he resumed his appearances on the local radio station.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=343}} In the early winter of 1932, he made appearances throughout East Texas until he collapsed during a show in [[Lufkin, Texas|Lufkin]] and was placed in an [[oxygen tent]].{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=344}} He then stopped performing at KMAC and stayed at home while he arranged a new recording session with Peer for May.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=347}}\n\nRodgers and his personal nurse, Cora Bedell, traveled to New York City on the [[SS Mohawk (1925)|SS ''Mohawk'']] and arrived on May 14, 1933. Peer left the singer to rest at his usual lodging, the Taft Hotel (earlier The Manger), for a few days before the session. Meanwhile, he assigned Rodgers a driver, known as Castro.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|p=349}} The recording session, with Fred Maisch engineering, began on May 17 at [[RCA Studios New York#24th St|RCA Victor's New York Studios at 153 E 24th Street]]. During the first two days, Rodgers recorded six numbers. The singer sat on an easy chair and was propped up by pillows to reach the microphone; the sessions were often paused as a result of his health. A new session was scheduled for May 24, 1933. Rodgers produced four songs and lay on a cot between takes. At the end of the day, he was helped into a cab and returned to his hotel.{{sfn|Porterfield, Nolan|2007|pp=350-351}} The next day, he recovered and then visited [[Coney Island]] with his driver. When returning, Rodgers decided to walk the last few blocks to the hotel, but he needed help to return to his room. He then suffered an intense cough, which eventually stopped.
