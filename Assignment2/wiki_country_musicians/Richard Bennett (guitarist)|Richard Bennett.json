As a touring sideman, he performed with [[Neil Diamond]] for seventeen years and [[Mark Knopfler]] since 1994. As a [[session musician]], he has worked with [[Billy Joel]],  [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Rodney Crowell]], and [[Vince Gill]]. He has produced albums for [[Steve Earle]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Marty Stuart]], and [[Kim Richey]].\n\n==Career==\nBennett began his career playing clubs in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], in the late 1960s, until he was discovered by [[Al Casey (rock & roll guitarist)|Al Casey]], which took him to [[Los Angeles]] where he had a lengthy career as a studio musician. He played on a few tracks on Neil Diamond's 1971 album ''[[Stones (Neil Diamond album)|Stones]]''; ''Moods'' was his first full album with him, and he played on every Diamond album until 1987 and toured with him for 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vguitar.com/features/artists/details.asp?AID=2263|title=Features-- Artists: Richard Bennett|last=Childs|first=Zac|date=3 May 2007|work=[[Vintage Guitar (magazine)|Vintage Guitar]]|access-date=2 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308022737/http://vguitar.com/features/artists/details.asp?AID=2263|archive-date=8 March 2009}}</ref> He also co-wrote with Diamond, including the up-tempo \"[[Forever in Blue Jeans]]\" from the 1978 album ''[[You Don't Bring Me Flowers (album)|You Don't Bring Me Flowers]]'', which reached the Top 20.\n\nOn 1975's \"[[Let Your Love Flow]]\" by [[The Bellamy Brothers]], Bennett plays lead guitars.  It also features in a UK [[Barclay's Bank]] commercial. The song was written by Larry Williams, a member of Neil Diamond's road crew.\n\nFormed in the late 1970s as [[Rodney Crowell]]'s road band, [[The Notorious Cherry Bombs]]' original members include guitarists [[Vince Gill]] and Richard Bennett, keyboardist [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], steel guitarist Hank DeVito, drummer [[Larrie Londin]] and bassist [[Emory Gordy, Jr.]] With a modified lineup the musicians went to the studio in early 2004 to record ''[[The Notorious Cherry Bombs (album)|The Notorious Cherry Bombs]]'', their first album as a band.\n\nFrom the liner notes of Bennett's solo album, ''Themes From A Rainy Decade'', Mark Knopfler writes, \"For almost ten years now I've felt very lucky having Richard Bennett as a pal and as a member of the band. His quiet, self-effacing manner hides an encyclopedic knowledge of all kinds of roots and rock music, from Hillbilly to Hawaiian, played effortlessly on a variety of instruments which appear out of a flight case as big as an Airstream trailer... May his cracking guitar playing find a place in your life as it has in mine.\"\n\nBennett's electric guitar intro to Emmylou Harris' \"Heaven Only Knows\" (from her Bennett-produced ''[[Bluebird (Emmylou Harris album)|Bluebird]]'' album) was the first sound heard on the 2004 season-opening episode of [[The Sopranos]].<ref>[http://www.tennessean.com/entertainment/music/archives/04/07/54523185.shtml Tennessean]</ref>\n\nBennett contributes electric sitar to the 2007 album ''American Standard'' by [[Thelonious Moog]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Personal life==\nBennett's brother is [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz]], drummer for [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] since 1980.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main| Richard Bennett discography}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.richard-bennett.com/ Official website]\n* {{Allmusic | id= richard-bennett-mn0000294018 | label= Richard Bennett}}\n* {{discogs artist|255390-Richard-Bennett|Richard Bennett}}\n{{Commons category-inline|Richard Bennett}}\n\n{{Mark Knopfler}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bennett, Richard}}\n[[Category:1951 births]]\n[[Category:American country guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:Record producers from Illinois]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:The Notorious Cherry Bombs members]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Chicago]]\n[[Category:American ukulele players]]\n[[Category:Pedal steel guitarists]]\n[[Category:American rock guitarists]]\n[[Category:American lead guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Illinois]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Lyle Lovett and His Large Band members]]"}]}}}}
