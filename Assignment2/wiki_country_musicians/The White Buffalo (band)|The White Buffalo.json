Along the way, Hickok meets the great Lakota warrior [[Crazy Horse]], who is also searching the plains for the giant white buffalo, which has killed Crazy Horse's daughter. Hickok and Crazy Horse team up to kill the elusive buffalo.\n\n(In [[Plains Indians]] culture, the [[white buffalo]] is a sacred animal that has great spiritual significance; in particular, it plays a crucial role in the history and religion of the [[Lakota people]] through the story of [[White Buffalo Calf Woman]].)\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Charles Bronson]] as [[Wild Bill Hickok]]\n* [[Will Sampson]] as [[Crazy Horse]]\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Charlie Zane\n* [[Slim Pickens]] as Abel Pickney\n* [[Kim Novak]] as Poker Jenny Schermerhorn\n* [[Clint Walker]] as Whistling Jack Kileen\n* [[Stuart Whitman]] as Winifred Coxy\n* [[John Carradine]] as Amos Briggs\n* [[Cara Williams]] as Cassie Ollinger\n* [[Douglas Fowley]] as Amos Bixby\n* Clifford A.

Reviewing the novel, [[Larry McMurtry]] said Sale \"chose a topic with great possibilities, turned it into a sharpened stake and proceeded to impale himself on it.\"<ref>Two Not Quite Historic Books: Book World NIGHT OF THE SILENT DRUMS.

On the first it is a wonderful, sensitive story between Wild Bill Hickok and the great Indian chief Crazy Horse. On the second it talks of a man having to find himself, seek his destiny, rid himself of fears and become more human.\"<ref name=\"los\">\"An Intrepid Gunfighter Meets Fear\" Gallo, William. ''Los Angeles Times'' July 25, 1976: c1.</ref>\n\nMuch of the film was shot on a soundstage in Los Angeles, with location shots in Colorado and New Mexico.  For the buffalo scenes, producer Laurentiis hired [[Carlo Rambaldi]] to design an animatronic full-size bison that would slide around on tracks. This was based on his larger-scale work on their previous collaboration ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' (1976).<ref>\"'Mad as Hell' in Beverly Hills\" Lee, Grant.

Hickok, who hates Indians, and Crazy Horse, who hates white men, grow to respect each other through the film. Courage kills racism. It's a shame this theme isn't developed more. The script, based on a Richard Sale novel, instead takes side trips into a standard barroom shootout and a Charles Bronson reunion with an old lady friend (Kim Novak).\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (June 8, 1977). \"The White Buffalo\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 6.</ref>\n\nArthur D. Murphy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote, \"Withheld for months from reviewers, 'The White Buffalo' is a turkey ... The trade has to wonder how a project like this gets off the ground, when the dialog is enough to invite jeers from an audience. The title beast looks like a hung-over carnival prize despite attempts at camouflage via hokey sound track noise, busy John Barry scoring, murky photography and fast editing.\"<ref name=\"murf\" /> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that the film \"is destined for almost instant obscurity in domestic release, a consummation that can't come a minute too soon for director J. Lee Thompson, star Charles Bronson and everyone else in an exposed position on this fiasco.\" He thought the buffalo looked very fake and \"[t]he producer under a white sheet chanting 'boogie-boogie-boogie' would have been more effective.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (June 3, 1977). \"The Movie\".

As the movie version stands, the bewildering lack of motivation for Hickok's recurring white buffalo nightmare\u2014from which he invariably wakes blasting away with pistols in each hand\u2014suggests, along with a lot of other inponderables, that a great deal of background exposition has either been eliminated or drastically reduced, leaving a peculiarly disassembled narrative in its wake ... Equally bizarre and inexact is the title beast itself\u2014a clumsy mechanical contrivance resembling a giant shaggy toy whose roars bear an uncomfortable similarity to the sounds of a growling stomach.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |date=February 1978 |title=The White Buffalo |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=45 |issue=529 |pages=32\u201333 }}</ref>\n\n\"''The White Buffalo''\" holds a 20% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on five reviews.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_white_buffalo | title=The White Buffalo - Rotten Tomatoes | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=May 5, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\nThe film screened on TV under the title '''''Hunt to Kill'''''.<ref>He Rejects Peeping \u2013 Tom Comedies, Ryan, Desmond.
