He worked odd jobs while struggling for success in music while burdened with medical expenses resulting from his son's defective [[esophagus]]. He and his wife soon divorced.\n\nHe got a job sweeping floors at [[Bradley Studios#Columbia Studios|Columbia Recording Studios]] in Nashville. He met [[June Carter]] there and asked her to give [[Johnny Cash]] a tape of his. She did, but Cash put it on a large pile with others. He also worked as a commercial helicopter pilot for south Louisiana firm [[Petroleum Helicopters International]] (PHI), based in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]. Kristofferson recalled of his days as a pilot, \"That was about the last three years before I started performing, before people started cutting my songs. I would work a week down here [in south Louisiana] for PHI, sitting on an oil platform and flying helicopters. Then I'd go back to Nashville at the end of the week and spend a week up there trying to pitch the songs, then come back down and write songs for another week. I can remember \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\" I wrote sitting on top of an oil platform.

''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]''.</ref> But upon hearing \"[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]\", Cash decided to record it, and in 1970 Kristofferson won Songwriter of the Year for the song at the [[Country Music Association Awards]].\n\n[[File:Kris Kristofferson Rita Coolidge.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Kristofferson with Rita Coolidge at the 1972 [[Dripping Springs Reunion]]]]\n\nIn 1966, [[Dave Dudley]] released a successful Kristofferson single, \"Viet Nam Blues.\" In 1967, Kristofferson signed to [[Epic Records]] and released a single, \"Golden Idol/Killing Time,\" but the song was not successful. Within the next few years, more Kristofferson originals hit the charts, performed by [[Roy Drusky]] (\"Jody and the Kid\"); [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]] & the Tennessee Walkers (\"From the Bottle to the Bottom\"); [[Ray Stevens]] (\"[[Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down]]\"); [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (\"Once More with Feeling\"); [[Faron Young]] (\"Your Time's Comin'\"); and [[Roger Miller]] (\"Me and Bobby McGee\", \"Best of all Possible Worlds\", and \"Darby's Castle\"). He was successful as a performer following Johnny Cash's introduction of him at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].\n\nKristofferson signed with [[Monument Records]] as a recording artist. In addition to running that label, [[Fred Foster]] also served as manager of [[Combine Music]], Kristofferson's songwriting label. His debut album for Monument in 1970\u2014''[[Kristofferson (album)|Kristofferson]]''\u2014included a few new songs as well as many of his previous hits. The album initially sold poorly, but would become a success the following year after it was re-released under the title ''Me & Bobby McGee''. Kristofferson's songs were still in demand. [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]] (\"[[For the Good Times (song)|For the Good Times]]\"), [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]] (\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\"), [[Waylon Jennings]] (\"The Taker\"), [[Bobby Bare]] (\"Come Sundown\"), [[Johnny Cash]] (\"Sunday Morning Coming Down\"), and [[Sammi Smith]] (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\") all recorded successful versions of his songs in the early 1970s. \"For the Good Times\" ([[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]]) won \"Song of the Year\" in 1970 from the [[Academy of Country Music]], while \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" (Johnny Cash) won the same award from the academy's rival, the [[Country Music Association]], in the same year. This is the only time an individual received the same award from these two organizations in the same year for different songs.\n\nIn 1971, [[Janis Joplin]], who had dated Kristofferson, had a number one hit with \"Me and Bobby McGee\" from her posthumous album ''[[Pearl (Janis Joplin album)|Pearl]]''. It stayed on the number-one spot on the charts for weeks. More hits followed from others: Ray Price (\"I'd Rather Be Sorry\"); [[Joe Simon (musician)|Joe Simon]] (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"); [[Bobby Bare]] (\"Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends\"); [[O.C. Smith]] (\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\"); [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] (\"Me and Bobby McGee\"); [[Patti Page]] (\"I'd Rather Be Sorry\"); and [[Peggy Little]] (\"I've Got to Have You\"). Country music performer [[Kenny Rogers]] recorded some of Kristofferson's songs, including a version of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" in 1969 with [[Kenny Rogers and The First Edition|the First Edition]] for the ''[[Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town (album)|Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town]]'' album.\n\nKristofferson released his second album\u2014''[[The Silver Tongued Devil and I]]''\u2014in 1971. It included \"[[Lovin' Her Was Easier (Than Anything I'll Ever Do Again)]]\". This success established Kristofferson's career as a recording artist. Soon after, Kristofferson made his acting debut in ''[[The Last Movie]]'' (directed by [[Dennis Hopper]]), and appeared at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]]. A portion of his Isle of Wight performance is featured on the three disc compilation, ''The First Great Rock Festivals of the Seventies''. In 1971, he acted in ''[[Cisco Pike]]'', and released his third album, ''[[Border Lord]]''. The album was all-new material and sales were sluggish. He also swept the [[Grammy Awards]] that year with numerous songs nominated, winning country song of the year for \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\". Kristofferson's 1972 fourth album, ''[[Jesus Was a Capricorn]]'', initially had slow sales, but the third single, \"[[Why Me (Kris Kristofferson song)|Why Me]]\", was a success and significantly increased album sales. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on November 8, 1973.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330 330]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Kristofferson appeared with [[Rita Coolidge]] on British TV on BBC's ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', performing a physically intimate version of \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\". Also in 1972, [[Al Green]] released his version of \"[[For the Good Times (song)|For the Good Times]]\" on the album ''[[I'm Still in Love with You (Al Green album)|I'm Still in Love with You]]''.\n\n=== Film ===\n[[File:Kristofferson - 78.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Kristofferson in 1978]]\nFor the next several years, Kristofferson focused on acting. He appeared in ''[[Cisco Pike]]'' (1972) with [[Gene Hackman]]; ''[[Blume in Love]]'' (1973), directed by [[Paul Mazursky]]; three [[Sam Peckinpah]] films: ''[[Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid]]'' (1973), ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'' (1974), and ''[[Convoy (1978 film)|Convoy]]'' (1978); and [[Michael Ritchie (filmmaker)|Michael Ritchie]]'s ''[[Semi-Tough]]'' (1977) with [[Burt Reynolds]]. He continued acting in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[Vigilante Force]]'' (1976), ''[[The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (film)|The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea]]'' (1976), and the romantic drama ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1976) with [[Barbra Streisand]], for which he received a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe Award for Best Actor]]. At the peak of his box office power, Kristofferson turned down [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'' (1977) and the romantic war film ''[[Hanover Street (film)|Hanover Street]]'' (1979). Despite his success with Streisand, Kristofferson's solo musical career headed downward with his non-charting ninth album, ''[[Shake Hands with the Devil (album)|Shake Hands with the Devil]]''. His next film, the two-part 1979 [[NBC]]-TV movie ''[[Freedom Road]]'', did not get good ratings.\n\nKristofferson was next cast in the lead role as the enigmatic Sheriff James Averill in [[Michael Cimino]]'s bleak and sprawling 1980 anti-Western ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]''. Despite being a scandalous studio-bankrupting and industry-changing failure at the time (it cost Kristofferson his Hollywood A-list status), the film gained critical recognition in subsequent years. In 1981, he co-starred with [[Jane Fonda]] in ''[[Rollover (film)|Rollover]]'', directed by [[Alan J. Pakula]]. In 1986, he starred in ''[[The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James]]'' with Johnny Cash and [[Flashpoint (1984 film)|''Flashpoint'']] in 1984, directed by William Tannen. This was followed, in 1985, by the [[neo-noir]] thriller ''[[Trouble in Mind (film)|Trouble In Mind]]'' co-starring [[Keith Carradine]] and [[Lori Singer]]. In 1987, Kristofferson starred in the seven-episode TV series ''[[Amerika (TV miniseries)|Amerika]]'' with [[Robert Urich]] and [[Christine Lahti]]. In 1989, he was the male lead in the film ''[[Millennium (film)|Millennium]]'' with [[Cheryl Ladd]]. In 1996, he earned a supporting role as Charlie Wade, a corrupt [[South Texas]] sheriff in John Sayles's ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'', a film nominated for an Oscar for Best Screenplay. In 1997, he co-starred in the film ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'' with [[Steven Seagal]].\n\nIn 1998, he took a role in the film ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'', alongside [[Wesley Snipes]], as [[Blade (comics)|Blade]]'s mentor [[Abraham Whistler]]. He reprised the role in ''[[Blade II]]'' (2002) and again in ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'' (2004). In 1998 he starred in ''[[Dance with Me (1998 film)|Dance with Me]]'' along with [[Vanessa Williams]] and [[Chayanne]]. In 1999, he co-starred with Mel Gibson in ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]''. He was then in the 2001 Tim Burton version of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. He has also played the title character \"Yohan\" as an old man in the Norwegian film ''Yohan\u2014the Children Wanderer''.  He co-starred in the 2011 film ''[[Dolphin Tale]]'' and its 2014 sequel, ''[[Dolphin Tale 2]]''. In 2012, Kristofferson was in ''[[Joyful Noise (film)|Joyful Noise]]'' with longtime friend [[Dolly Parton]]. In 2013, Kristofferson co-starred in ''[[The Motel Life (film)|The Motel Life]]'', as well as ''[[Angels Sing]]'' with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Lyle Lovett]]. In 2006, Kristofferson starred with [[Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold]] in the film ''[[Disappearances (film)|Disappearances]]'' about whiskey running from Quebec to the US during the [[Great Depression]].\n\n=== Mid-career ===\nAfter his singing success in the early 1970s, Kristofferson met singer Rita Coolidge. They married in 1973 and released an album titled ''[[Full Moon (Kris Kristofferson album)|Full Moon]]'', another success buoyed by numerous hit singles and Grammy nominations. His fifth album, ''[[Spooky Lady's Sideshow]]'', released in 1974, was a commercial failure, setting the trend for most of the rest of his musical career. Artists such as [[Ronnie Milsap]] and [[John Duncan (artist)|Johnny Duncan]] continued to record Kristofferson's material with success, but his distinctively rough voice and anti-pop sound kept his own audience to a minimum. Meanwhile, more artists took his songs to the top of the charts, including [[Willie Nelson]], whose 1979 LP release of ''[[Sings Kristofferson|(Willie Nelson) Sings Kristofferson]]'' reached number five on the U.S. Country Music chart and certified Platinum in the U.S.\n\nIn 1979, Kristofferson traveled to [[Havana]], Cuba, to participate in the historic [[Havana Jam]] festival that took place on March 2\u20134, alongside Rita Coolidge, [[Stephen Stills]], the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the [[Trio of Doom]], [[Fania All-Stars]], [[Billy Swan]], [[Bonnie Bramlett]], [[Mike Finnigan]], [[Weather Report]], and [[Billy Joel]], plus an array of Cuban artists such as [[Irakere]], [[Pacho Alonso]], [[Tata G\u00fcines]], and [[Orquesta Arag\u00f3n]]. His performance is captured on Ernesto Juan Castellanos's documentary ''Havana Jam '79''.\n\nOn November 18, 1979, Kristofferson and Coolidge appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', where Kristofferson sang \"[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]\" with [[Miss Piggy]], Coolidge sang \"[[We're All Alone]]\" with forest animals, and the pair sang \"[[Full Moon (Kris Kristofferson album)|Song I'd Like to Sing]]\" with the Muppet monsters. They divorced in 1980.\n\n===Later years===\nIn 1982, Kristofferson joined [[Willie Nelson]], [[Dolly Parton]], and [[Brenda Lee]] on ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', a double album consisting of remastered and updated performances of recordings the four artists had made for the Monument label during the mid-1960s; the album reached the top ten on the U.S. country album charts. He married again, to Lisa Meyers, and concentrated on films for a time, appearing in the 1984 releases ''[[The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck]]'', ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]]'' and ''[[Songwriter (1984 film)|Songwriter]]''. Nelson and Kristofferson both appeared in ''Songwriter'', and Kristofferson was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song Score]]. The album ''[[Music from Songwriter]]'', featuring Nelson-Kristofferson duets, was a massive country success.\n\nNelson and Kristofferson continued their partnership, and added [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Johnny Cash]] to form the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]]. Their first album, ''[[Highwayman (The Highwaymen album)|Highwayman]]'', was a success, and the supergroup continued working together for a time. The single from the album, also entitled \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\", written by [[Jimmy Webb]] (and originally recorded by him in 1977), was awarded the ACM's single of the year in 1985.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224171729/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kristofferson_kris/bio.jhtml \"Kris Kristofferson Biography\"] \"[[Country Music Television|CMT]]\" 2004.</ref> In 1985, Kristofferson starred in ''[[Trouble in Mind (film)|Trouble in Mind]]'' and released ''[[Repossessed (album)|Repossessed]]'', a politically aware album that was a country success, particularly \"They Killed Him\" (also performed by [[Bob Dylan]]), a tribute to his heroes, including [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], Jesus, and [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Kristofferson also appeared in ''[[Amerika (miniseries)|Amerika]]'' at about the same time, a miniseries that attempted to depict life in America under [[Soviet]] control.\n\n[[File:Kris Kristofferson SXSW 2006 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Kristofferson at the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] Festival]]\nIn spite of the success of ''[[Highwayman 2]]'' in 1990, Kristofferson's solo recording career slipped significantly in the early 1990s, though he continued to record successfully with the Highwaymen. ''[[Lone Star (1996 film)|Lone Star]]'' (1996 film by [[John Sayles]]) reinvigorated Kristofferson's acting career, and he soon appeared in ''[[Blade (1998 film)|Blade]]'', ''[[Blade II]]'', ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'', ''[[A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries (film)|A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries]]'', ''[[Fire Down Below (1997 film)|Fire Down Below]]'', [[Tim Burton]]'s remake of ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', ''[[Chelsea Walls]]'', ''[[Payback (1999 film)|Payback]]'', ''[[The Jacket]]'', and ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]''.\n\nThe [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] inducted Kristofferson in 1985, as had the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] earlier, in 1977. In 1999, ''[[The Austin Sessions (Kris Kristofferson album)|The Austin Sessions]]'', was released, an album on which Kristofferson reworked some of his favorite songs with the help of artists such as [[Mark Knopfler]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. Shortly after the album's release, he underwent [[coronary bypass surgery]].<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nIn 2003, ''[[Broken Freedom Song: Live from San Francisco|Broken Freedom Song]]'' was released, a live album recorded in San Francisco. That year, he received the \"Spirit of Americana\" free speech award from the [[Americana Music Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20031009_americana_awards_honor_kristofferson_douglas_prine_and_phillips|title=Americana Awards Honor Kristofferson, Douglas, Prine and Phillips|date=October 8, 2003|website=BMI|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref> In 2004, he was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. On Oct. 21, 2005 the movie ''[[Dreamer (2005 film)|Dreamer]]'' was released, in which Kristofferson played the role of \u201cPop\u201d, a retired thoroughbred horse trainer. The movie was inspired by the true story of the mare Mariah\u2019s Storm who won the Turfway Breeders Cup Classic. 2006, he received the Johnny Mercer Award from the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] and released his first album full of new material in 11 years; ''[[This Old Road]]''. On April 21, 2007, Kristofferson won [[Country Music Television|CMT]]'s Johnny Cash Visionary Award. [[Rosanne Cash]], Cash's daughter, presented the honor during the April 16 awards show in Nashville. Previous recipients include Cash, [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], [[Loretta Lynn]], [[Reba McEntire]], and the [[Dixie Chicks]]. \"John was my hero before he was my friend, and anything with his name on it is really an honor in my eyes,\" Kristofferson said during a phone interview. \"I was thinking back to when I first met him, and if I ever thought that I'd be getting an award with his name on it, it would have carried me through a lot of hard times.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/12/AR2007031200851.html|title=Kris Kristofferson to Receive CMT Award|first=JOHN|last=GEROME|date=March 12, 2007|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, Kristofferson was featured on CMT's ''Studio 330 Sessions'' where he played many of his hits.\n\nOn June 13, 2008, Kristofferson performed an acoustic in-the-round set with [[Patty Griffin]] and [[Randy Owen]] ([[Alabama (band)|Alabama]]) for a special taping of a [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] songwriters series aired in December. Each performer played five songs. Kristofferson's set included \"The Best of All Possible Worlds\", \"Darby's Castle\", \"Casey's Last Ride\", \"Me and Bobby McGee\", and \"Here Comes that Rainbow Again\". Taping was done in Nashville.\n\nKristofferson released a new album of original songs entitled ''[[Closer to the Bone]]'' on September 28, 2009. It is produced by [[Don Was]] on the [[New West]] label. Prior to the release, Kristofferson remarked: \"I like the intimacy of the new album.
