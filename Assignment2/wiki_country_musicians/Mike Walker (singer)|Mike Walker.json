In 2000 he was signed by [[DreamWorks Nashville]] and in 2001, he released his self-titled debut album. This album produced his only chart single in \"Honey Do\", which peaked at number 42 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. He also toured with [[Brooks & Dunn]] on the first annual \"Neon Circus Tour\" which also featured [[Toby Keith]], [[Montgomery Gentry]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Cledus T. Judd]] after the release of his album,<ref name=\"aboutbio\"/> although its second through fifth singles all failed to chart. Included on the album were covers of [[Rodney Crowell]]'s 1990 single \"[[What Kind of Love]]\", [[Billy \"Crash\" Craddock]]'s 1974 single \"[[Rub It In]]\", and [[T. Graham Brown]]'s 1999 single \"Memphis Women and Chicken\". [[Gary Allan]] also recorded the song \"See If I Care\" on his album of the [[See If I Care (Gary Allan album)|same name]], and \"Honey Do\" was originally recorded by [[Keith Harling]] on his 1999 album ''[[Bring It On (Keith Harling album)|Bring It On]]''.\n\nIn the late 2000s, Walker began performing in [[Branson, Missouri]].\n\n==''Mike Walker'' (2001)==\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Mike Walker\n| type         = studio\n| artist       = Mike Walker\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = {{Start date|2001|10|09}}\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = Country\n| length       =\n| label        = DreamWorks Nashville\n| producer     = [[James Stroud]]<br />[[Don Cook]]\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r555769|pure_url=yes}}|title=''Mike Walker'' review|last=Widran|first=Jonathan|work=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[About.com]]\n| rev2Score = (favorable)<ref name=\"aboutreview\">{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/library/blmikewalkerrev.htm|title=CD Review: Mike Walker \u2013 ''Mike Walker''|last=Attebury|first=Carrie|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===Track listing===\n#\"Honey Do\" ([[Jeffrey Steele]], [[Al Anderson (NRBQ)|Al Anderson]], [[Kent Blazy]]) \u2013 3:11\n#\"Stones in the Road\" ([[James House (singer)|James House]], [[Wally Wilson]]) \u2013 4:32\n#\"This Is That\" (Anderson, [[Tom Shapiro]]) \u2013 4:01\n#\"Who's Your Daddy?\" ([[Frank J.
